# 10.2 The President Nobody Owned

*November 2000 - January 2001*

The presidential election of 2000 would be remembered in the path not taken as a constitutional crisis—butterfly ballots in Florida, hanging chads, Brooks Brothers riots, Supreme Court intervention in *Bush v. Gore*, and a president elected with fewer popular votes than his opponent. Democracy itself seemed fragile, contested, illegitimate.

This timeline's 2000 election was different. It was the first presidential race where all fifty states used Ranked Choice Voting. Six major candidates competed. Every voter could express their full preferences. The result was decisive, legitimate, and revealed something the two-party duopoly had hidden: Americans wanted leadership that didn't belong to either establishment party.

They chose Al Gore, but barely. And in choosing him, they also chose a Congress that would force him to govern in coalition rather than from partisan dominance. The president who emerged from this process was nobody's creature—not the Democratic establishment's, not corporate donors', not party bosses'. He belonged to the coalition that elected him and the voters who ranked him.

## The Six-Way Race

By June 2000, six candidates had qualified for automatic ballot access in all fifty states under the Federal RCV Act's provisions:

**Al Gore (Democrat):** Vice President under Clinton, running on continuation of 1990s prosperity, healthcare expansion, environmental protection, and fiscal discipline. Politically moderate, environmentally progressive, establishment pedigree. Campaign message: "Prosperity and Progress."

**George W. Bush (Republican):** Governor of Texas, running on "compassionate conservatism," education reform, tax cuts, and military rebuilding. Establishment Republican with populist touches. Campaign message: "A Fresh Start."

**Ralph Nader (Green Party):** Consumer advocate, running on corporate accountability, environmental justice, universal healthcare, and campaign finance reform. Progressive challenger to Democratic establishment from the left. Campaign message: "People Over Profits."

**Ross Perot (Reform Party):** Texas businessman, 1992 and 1996 candidate, running at age 70 on fiscal responsibility, electoral reform, and opposition to corporate trade agreements. Populist centrist, suspicious of both establishments. Campaign message: "Government for the People."

**Pat Buchanan (Conservative Party):** Former Republican, split from party over trade and immigration, running on economic nationalism, traditional values, and non-interventionist foreign policy. Right-wing populist. Campaign message: "America First."

**Harry Browne (Libertarian Party):** Financial writer, running on minimal government, individual liberty, non-intervention abroad, and free market economics. Philosophical libertarian. Campaign message: "End Big Government."

In the path not taken, third-party candidates would be dismissed as spoilers. Nader would be blamed for "costing Gore the election" in Florida. The two-party duopoly would use the 2000 chaos to argue against third parties rather than for electoral reform.

Here, third parties were legitimate competitors. The question wasn't "Are you throwing your vote away?" but "How do you rank all six?"

## The Campaign

The six-way race fundamentally changed campaign dynamics:

**Coalition Building Over Base Mobilization:** Under two-party plurality voting, campaigns focused on turning out their base and winning undecided voters in the middle. Under RCV, campaigns also needed to attract second-choice and third-choice rankings from supporters of other candidates.

This changed messaging. Gore couldn't just attack Bush; he needed to appeal to Nader and Perot voters as a second choice. Bush couldn't just attack Gore; he needed to appeal to Buchanan and Perot voters. Negative campaigning risked alienating voters whose second-choice rankings you wanted.

The result was more substantive policy debate and less personal attack. Not because candidates suddenly became noble, but because the incentive structure rewarded discussing ideas over demonizing opponents.

**Regional Variation:** Different regions saw different race dynamics. In the Northeast and West Coast, the main contest was Gore vs. Nader, with Bush a distant third. In the South and Mountain West, it was Bush vs. Gore, with Buchanan third. In the agricultural Midwest, all six candidates competed seriously, with Perot strong and coalition-building essential.

**Debate Dynamics:** The Presidential Debate Commission initially tried to limit debates to candidates polling above 15%, which would have excluded Browne and potentially Buchanan. Public backlash was immediate. Newspapers editorialized that excluding candidates with automatic ballot access in all fifty states contradicted the democratic promise of RCV. The Commission backed down.

All six candidates participated in four presidential debates—September 30, October 11, October 17, and October 25. The expanded stage created substantive policy discussions impossible in two-way races:

On healthcare, the positions ranged from Browne's "government out of healthcare entirely" to Nader's "single-payer Medicare for all," with Gore's "public option expansion," Bush's "health savings accounts and insurance reform," Perot's "cost controls and generic drug access," and Buchanan's "protect Medicare, control immigration costs" staking out distinct positions.

On trade, the divide crossed party lines: Bush and Gore supported NAFTA expansion, while Nader, Perot, and Buchanan opposed new trade agreements without labor and environmental protections. Browne supported free trade but opposed government-negotiated agreements as corporate favoritism.

Viewers could see the actual ideological spectrum instead of having it compressed into two artificial bundles.

**Media Coverage:** Political journalism adapted to six-way races. Instead of tracking "Bush vs. Gore," polls measured first-choice preferences and second-choice rankings. Sample results from October 20, 2000:

**First Choice:**
- Gore: 38%
- Bush: 32%
- Nader: 12%
- Perot: 9%
- Buchanan: 6%
- Browne: 3%

**Second Choice (among those ranking each candidate first):**
- Gore voters: Nader 68%, Perot 18%, Bush 8%, others 6%
- Bush voters: Buchanan 42%, Perot 28%, Gore 18%, others 12%
- Nader voters: Gore 88%, Perot 6%, others 6%
- Perot voters: Gore 48%, Bush 44%, others 8%
- Buchanan voters: Bush 82%, Perot 12%, others 6%
- Browne voters: Bush 58%, Perot 24%, others 18%

These numbers told a more complete story than simple head-to-head matchups. They showed that Gore would likely win after vote redistribution, but it would be close.

## Election Night

November 7, 2000, began like any modern election—networks tracking early returns, exit polls, state-by-state counts. But the counting process was different. Some states (those with experience using RCV) could report results quickly. Others (new to RCV) took longer to tabulate multiple rounds.

By midnight Eastern time, the broad outlines were clear:

**First Round National Popular Vote:**
- Al Gore (D): 41.2%
- George W. Bush (R): 34.8%
- Ralph Nader (Green): 10.4%
- Ross Perot (Reform): 7.2%
- Pat Buchanan (Conservative): 4.8%
- Harry Browne (Libertarian): 1.6%

No candidate had a majority. Under plurality voting, Gore would have won with 41.2%—a decisive minority. Under RCV, vote redistribution would continue.

**Second Round (Browne eliminated, votes redistributed):**
- Gore: 41.8%
- Bush: 35.4%
- Nader: 10.6%
- Perot: 7.4%
- Buchanan: 4.8%

**Third Round (Buchanan eliminated, votes redistributed):**
- Bush: 38.2%
- Gore: 42.4%
- Nader: 10.8%
- Perot: 8.6%

**Fourth Round (Perot eliminated, votes redistributed):**
- Gore: 46.8%
- Bush: 42.4%
- Nader: 10.8%

**Fifth Round (Nader eliminated, votes redistributed):**
- Al Gore: 52.2%
- George W. Bush: 47.8%

Gore won with 52.2% of votes after five rounds of redistribution—a legitimate majority. But the Electoral College added complexity.

## The Electoral College Count

The Electoral College still existed, though the reform amendment passed in 1999 was working through state ratification (it would be ratified in 2003, too late for 2000). States allocated their electoral votes using RCV within each state, but still used winner-take-all systems in most cases.

The state-by-state results after RCV tabulation:

**Gore (Democrat) - 291 electoral votes:**
California (54), New York (33), Pennsylvania (23), Illinois (22), Michigan (18), New Jersey (15), Massachusetts (12), Washington (11), Maryland (10), Wisconsin (11), Minnesota (10), Oregon (7), Connecticut (8), Hawaii (4), Vermont (3), Rhode Island (4), Delaware (3), Maine (4), D.C. (3)

**Bush (Republican) - 247 electoral votes:**
Texas (32), Florida (25), Ohio (21), North Carolina (14), Georgia (13), Virginia (13), Indiana (12), Missouri (11), Tennessee (11), Alabama (9), Louisiana (9), South Carolina (8), Kentucky (8), Colorado (8), Oklahoma (8), Mississippi (7), Arkansas (6), Kansas (6), Utah (5), Nebraska (5), West Virginia (5), Idaho (4), New Hampshire (4), Montana (3), South Dakota (3), North Dakota (3), Alaska (3), Wyoming (3)

**Nader (Green) - 0 electoral votes**
(Strong showings in Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, but Gore won after redistribution)

Gore won the Electoral College 291-247, a comfortable margin. But the popular vote and EC results revealed important patterns:

**Pattern 1: Urban-Rural Divide:** Gore won large urban states decisively. Bush won small rural states. The geographic polarization visible in the path not taken was present here too, but RCV made it less toxic because voters in "losing" states had still ranked their preferences and seen them counted.

**Pattern 2: Nader Voters Chose Gore Second:** In every state, when Nader was eliminated, his votes broke 85-90% for Gore. The claim that Nader "cost Gore the election"—central to the path not taken—was empirically false here. Nader voters got to vote their conscience first and their compromise second. Democracy worked.

**Pattern 3: Perot Voters Split:** When Perot was eliminated, his voters split about 55-45 for Gore over Bush. Perot's populist economic message attracted voters who wanted neither establishment party, but they preferred Gore's stakeholder capitalism to Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy.

**Pattern 4: Regional Coalitions:** Some states showed fascinating coalition patterns. In Kansas, Bush won 48.2% to Gore's 47.6% to Reform's 4.2% in the first round, but after redistribution, Gore won 51.2% to Bush's 48.8% because Reform voters ranked Gore second. Agricultural states with strong cooperative movements preferred Gore's cooperative economics.

## The Mandate Question

Gore had won decisively—52.2% popular vote after redistribution, 291 electoral votes—but the first-round result told a different story. Only 41.2% of voters had ranked him first. He'd won because he was acceptable as a second choice to Nader, Perot, and some Buchanan voters.

This created a unique kind of mandate. Gore had majority support, but not first-choice majority support. He'd been elected to govern in coalition, not to pursue a purely partisan agenda.

The Congressional results reinforced this:

**House (2001-2002):**
- Democrats: 194 seats
- Republicans: 178 seats
- Reform: 34 seats
- Greens: 18 seats
- Labor: 9 seats
- Libertarians: 2 seats

**Senate (2001-2002):**
- Democrats: 44 seats
- Republicans: 36 seats
- Reform: 12 seats
- Greens: 6 seats
- Labor: 2 seats

No party had a majority in either chamber. Coalition governance would continue. Gore would need to work with the Democratic-Reform coalition that had governed since 1997, and he'd need to negotiate with Greens and moderate Republicans to build majority support for legislation.

This was unprecedented in modern American history. Presidents had faced opposition Congresses before, but never a Congress where *no party* held a majority. Gore couldn't fall back on party discipline. He'd have to build legislative coalitions issue by issue.

## The Inaugural Address

January 20, 2001, was cold and clear in Washington. Al Gore took the oath of office, becoming the 43rd president of the United States. His inaugural address acknowledged the unique moment:

"My fellow Americans, I stand before you as the first president elected by Ranked Choice Voting in all fifty states. I won not with 43% or 48% of first-place votes, but with 52% after Americans expressed their full preferences. Some of you ranked me first. Many ranked me second or third. All of your voices were heard. All of your votes counted.

"This is how democracy should work. Not forcing you into false choices between two preselected options, but letting you express what you actually believe and finding the candidate who commands genuine majority support.

"I take office knowing that I govern not by the grace of a political party, but by the consent of a coalition. The Congress you elected has six parties. Neither chamber has a majority party. We will govern through negotiation, through compromise, through coalition-building.

"Some will say this makes America weak. I say it makes America democratic. The challenges we face—climate change, healthcare access, fiscal responsibility, educational excellence, technological transformation—require solutions that transcend partisan divisions. Coalition governance forces us to find those solutions.

"I didn't win because I promised everything to everyone. I won because enough Americans—from different parties, different ideologies, different backgrounds—decided I was acceptable. Not perfect. Not everything they wanted. But acceptable. Worth ranking first, or second, or third.

"That's the mandate I carry. Not to govern for Democrats, but to govern for the coalition that elected me. Not to pursue a partisan agenda, but to build majority support for policies that address real problems.

"We've transformed how we elect our leaders. Now we must transform how we govern. From partisan warfare to coalition cooperation. From winner-take-all dominance to negotiated compromise. From party loyalty to democratic accountability.

"The world is watching. Multi-party democracies across the globe have shown that coalition governance can work. Today, America joins them. Not because we think they're better than us, but because we've learned that democracy is better when voters get real choices.

"Together, we will show that coalition governance delivers results. That multi-party democracy strengthens rather than weakens. That when you give Americans real choices, they'll choose wisely, and the government they elect will serve them well.

"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."

The speech marked a turning point. For the first time since the 1850s, an American president explicitly acknowledged governing in coalition across multiple parties. The two-party duopoly—140 years old, seemingly permanent—was over.

## The First Hundred Days

Gore's first hundred days tested whether presidential coalition governance could work:

**Cabinet Formation:** Gore appointed a coalition cabinet:
- Secretary of State: Madeleine Albright (D)
- Secretary of Treasury: Robert Rubin (D)
- Secretary of Defense: William Cohen (R) - Republican Senator who had sponsored the 1994 RCV Act
- Attorney General: Janet Reno (D)
- Secretary of Interior: Bruce Babbitt (D)
- Secretary of Energy: Bill Richardson (D)
- EPA Administrator: Carol Browner (D)
- Secretary of Agriculture: Tom Harkin (Reform) - Iowa Senator and farmer advocate
- Secretary of Commerce: Norman Mineta (D)
- Special Advisor on Cooperative Economics: Thomas Anderson (Reform) - wind farmer Senator from Kansas

The inclusion of Republicans and Reform members signaled genuine coalition governance, not token appointments.

**Legislative Strategy:** Gore worked with Congressional coalition leadership to identify consensus areas:

**March 2001:** Energy Security and Climate Act passed 248-187 (House) and 56-44 (Senate). Expanded renewable energy tax credits, funded municipal broadband deployment to rural areas, increased CAFE standards for vehicles, invested $42 billion over five years in renewable energy research and deployment.

Coalition Democrats, Reform, Greens, and Labor voted yes. Republicans split—moderates from rural states with renewable energy interests voted yes, conservatives voted no.

**April 2001:** Healthcare Access Expansion Act passed 242-193 (House) and 54-46 (Senate). Created public option for health insurance (competing with private insurers), allowed Medicare negotiations for prescription drug prices, expanded Medicaid coverage to 150% of poverty line.

Coalition Democrats, Greens, and Labor voted yes. Reform split—fiscal conservatives worried about costs, but populists supported healthcare access. Some moderate Republicans voted yes.

**May 2001:** Campaign Finance Reform Act passed 268-167 (House) and 62-38 (Senate). Banned soft money contributions, required disclosure of all donors above $200, expanded public financing for House and Senate campaigns, overturned *Citizens United* preemptively by limiting corporate political expenditures.

Broad coalition—Democrats, Reform, Greens, Labor, and some Republicans concerned about corporate influence voted yes.

The legislative productivity matched the 1997-2000 Congress. Coalition governance worked at the presidential level just as it had worked at the congressional level.

## The Deeper Transformation

Underneath the legislative victories, Gore's coalition presidency demonstrated something more fundamental: the presidency could function democratically rather than as an elected monarchy.

**Checks and Balances Restored:** When one party controlled presidency and Congress (as often happened under two-party dominance), checks and balances weakened. Party loyalty overrode institutional loyalty. Here, with six parties and coalition governance, Congress checked presidential overreach regardless of party affiliation. Gore couldn't rely on Democratic congressional majorities rubber-stamping his agenda. He had to negotiate.

**Transparency Increased:** Coalition governance required transparency. Gore couldn't make backroom deals with party leaders and whip the caucus into line. He had to publicly explain policies, build support across parties, and demonstrate broad majority support. This made governance more democratic.

**Accountability Improved:** Under two-party dominance, voters could only hold presidents accountable every four years by switching parties. Under coalition governance, accountability was continuous. If Gore lost Reform or Green support, his coalition collapsed. He needed to maintain majority approval, not just partisan loyalty.

**Moderation Encouraged:** Gore had been elected by voters who ranked him first, second, or third. He needed to remain acceptable to all three groups. This created incentives toward moderation and consensus-building that didn't exist under two-party dominance. Not moderate in the sense of centrist mush, but moderate in the sense of respecting that different constituencies wanted different things and governance required balancing those preferences.

## The Contrast

In the path not taken, the 2000 election would traumatize American democracy. Bush would win the Electoral College 271-266 after the Supreme Court stopped Florida's recount. He would lose the popular vote to Gore by 543,000 votes but govern as if he had a mandate. The legitimacy crisis would never fully heal.

Dick Cheney would become the most powerful Vice President in history, operating a shadow government. The unitary executive theory would expand presidential power dramatically. Checks and balances would erode. Partisanship would intensify.

Here, none of that happened. Gore won legitimately—52.2% popular vote after redistribution, 291 electoral votes. No one questioned the result. Democracy worked cleanly.

But Gore also governed with constraints. He couldn't pursue a partisan agenda because he didn't have partisan majorities. He had to build coalitions. Presidential power was constrained by democratic necessity.

The presidency was weaker in one sense—less ability to dominate—but stronger in another—more legitimate, more accountable, more democratic.

Maria Rodriguez, the 48-year-old solar cooperative worker from New Mexico who had voted in every election since 1976, explained the difference in an interview with the *Albuquerque Journal*:

"I ranked Nader first, Gore second. Nader didn't win, but my vote still counted—Gore got my second-choice vote and won with it. I'm part of the coalition that elected him. He knows he needs Green voters like me. If he wants my vote in 2004, he needs to deliver on climate action.

"That's accountability. Not 'vote Democrat because Republicans are worse,' but 'vote based on actual performance and rank your preferences honestly.' That's what democracy looks like."

Fifty-two percent of Americans—the coalition that elected Gore—agreed. The president nobody owned would govern for the coalition that chose him.

Democracy had been completed.
