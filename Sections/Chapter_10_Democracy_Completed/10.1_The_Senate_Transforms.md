# 10.1 The Senate Transforms

*November 1998*

The Senate—designed by the Founders as the "cooling saucer" of American democracy, the deliberative body insulated from popular passion—had always been more resistant to change than the House. Senators served six-year terms rather than two. Only one-third faced election in any given cycle. The institution valued seniority, tradition, and continuity.

But even the Senate couldn't resist the democratic momentum that Ranked Choice Voting had unleashed. The 1998 midterm elections would test whether multi-party politics could penetrate the upper chamber, or whether the Senate's institutional conservatism would preserve two-party dominance.

The answer came on November 3, 1998, when voters in 34 states elected Senators using Ranked Choice Voting for the first time. The results transformed the chamber.

## The Class of 1998

Thirty-four Senate seats were up for election in 1998—the Class of 1992, elected in the three-way race that had catalyzed the RCV movement. In the path not taken, Republicans would win 8 seats from Democrats, expanding their majority to 55-45 and setting the stage for increased partisan warfare.

Here, the results looked entirely different:

**Final Senate Composition (January 1999):**
- Democrats: 42 seats
- Republicans: 38 seats
- Reform Party: 11 seats
- Green Party: 6 seats
- Labor Party: 2 seats
- Libertarian Party: 1 seat

For the first time since the 1850s, the Senate included more than two parties. And like the House after 1996, no single party held a majority. Coalition governance had come to the upper chamber.

The geographic and ideological distribution revealed how multi-party politics was reshaping representation:

**Reform Party Senators (11 total):**
- Agricultural and small industrial states: Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Montana, both Dakotas, Idaho
- Fiscal conservative, socially moderate, populist economic message
- Built on wind cooperative networks and agricultural cooperative traditions
- Won by being ranked first by independents, second by Republicans or Democrats depending on district lean

**Green Party Senators (6 total):**
- Progressive urban states: Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, Rhode Island, plus California (1 of 2 seats), Washington (1 of 2 seats)
- Environmental protection, renewable energy expansion, social justice
- Won by being ranked first by progressives, second by moderate Democrats
- Built on municipal RCV experience and environmental cooperative movements

**Labor Party Senators (2 total):**
- Industrial union strongholds: Michigan, Pennsylvania
- Worker rights, trade protections, cooperative ownership expansion
- Won by being ranked first by union members, second by Democrats
- Represented districts where 60%+ workers belonged to unions

**Libertarian Party Senator (1 total):**
- Alaska (replacing Republican incumbent)
- Small government, individual liberty, resource extraction rights
- Won by being ranked first by libertarian conservatives, second by Republicans

The pattern that had emerged in the 1996 House elections held in the Senate: RCV allowed voters to express their actual preferences, and when they did, they elected representatives across a genuine ideological spectrum rather than forcing everyone into two partisan boxes.

## Key Races

Several Senate races illustrated how Ranked Choice Voting changed campaign dynamics and outcomes:

### Kansas: The Wind Farmer Becomes Senator

Thomas Anderson, the wind cooperative farmer from Chapter 8 who had been elected to the House in 1996 as a Reform Party member, ran for Senate in 1998 against incumbent Republican Sam Brownback.

In the path not taken, Brownback would win re-election with 65% in a two-way race against an underfunded Democrat. Here, it was a three-way race:

**Round 1:**
- Sam Brownback (R): 42.1%
- Thomas Anderson (Reform): 38.4%
- Mary Wilson (D): 17.8%
- Others: 1.7%

**Round 2 (Others eliminated):**
- Brownback: 42.8%
- Anderson: 39.2%
- Wilson: 18.0%

**Round 3 (Wilson eliminated, votes redistributed):**
- Thomas Anderson (Reform): 51.2%
- Sam Brownback (R): 48.8%

Anderson won because Wilson's voters—Democrats in a conservative state—ranked the Reform Party candidate second at a 72% rate. They preferred Anderson's fiscal conservatism with social moderation and cooperative economics to Brownback's social conservatism and corporate-aligned economics.

Anderson's victory speech captured the transformation: "I'm a farmer who put wind turbines on my land because the cooperative model works. I went to Congress in 1996 because I believe government should work the same way—democratically, accountably, for regular people instead of powerful interests. Now I'm going to the Senate to continue that work. This is what democracy looks like when voters get real choices."

### Vermont: The Green Party Breaks Through

Bernie Sanders, who had served in the House as an Independent since 1991 and caucused with Democrats, faced a decision in 1998: run for Senate as an Independent, join the Democrats, or join the emerging Green Party.

He chose Green, running on the party's platform of environmental justice, economic democracy, and aggressive climate action. The race became a three-way contest:

**Round 1:**
- Bernie Sanders (Green): 44.2%
- Jack McMullen (R): 31.4%
- Jan Backus (D): 22.8%
- Others: 1.6%

**Round 2 (Others eliminated):**
- Sanders: 45.0%
- McMullen: 32.0%
- Backus: 23.0%

**Round 3 (McMullen eliminated):**
- Bernie Sanders (Green): 62.4%
- Jan Backus (D): 37.6%

Sanders won decisively after Republican voters were eliminated, because even conservative Vermonters ranked him second over the Democrat. His decades of service and consistent message earned him cross-partisan respect. Under plurality voting, he might have faced pressure to join Democrats to avoid "splitting the vote." Under RCV, he could run as Green and win with an outright majority after redistribution.

"This is how democracy should work," Sanders said in his victory speech. "Voters should be able to choose candidates based on their actual values, not based on strategic calculations about who's electable. Ranked Choice Voting makes that possible. Tonight, Vermont voters didn't waste any votes. They expressed their preferences honestly, and the system delivered a legitimate majority winner."

### Michigan: Labor Party Wins Union Stronghold

Michigan's Senate race tested whether the Labor Party—explicitly advocating for worker ownership and union power—could win in a major industrial state. The race featured:

**Round 1:**
- Jennifer Granholm (D): 38.8%
- Robert Martinez (Labor): 32.4%
- Spencer Abraham (R-incumbent): 26.2%
- Others: 2.6%

**Round 2 (Others eliminated):**
- Granholm: 39.2%
- Martinez: 33.0%
- Abraham: 27.8%

**Round 3 (Abraham eliminated):**
- Robert Martinez (Labor): 52.8%
- Jennifer Granholm (D): 47.2%

Martinez won because Republican voters—facing elimination of their candidate—ranked the Labor Party candidate over the Democrat at a 54% rate. Why? Michigan Republicans included many union members who were Republicans for cultural reasons but supported worker rights economically. Given a choice between a Democrat and a Labor candidate who explicitly championed worker ownership and cooperative economics, they chose Labor.

Martinez's background mattered: he was the retrained factory worker from Chapter 8 who had become a programmer at a software cooperative, then entered politics to advocate for cooperative ownership expansion. His message resonated across traditional partisan lines: "I've worked in traditional corporations and worker-owned cooperatives. The difference is night and day. When workers own their companies, they care about quality, sustainability, and community. That's what I want for all of Michigan. Not government ownership—worker ownership. Not socialism—democracy applied to economics."

## The Coalition Math

With no party holding a Senate majority, coalition formation became essential. The math offered several possibilities:

**Option 1: Democratic-Led Progressive Coalition**
- Democrats (42) + Greens (6) + Labor (2) = 50 seats (tie, Vice President breaks)
- Vice President Al Gore (Democrat) would provide the tiebreaking vote
- Progressive policy agenda, but minimal margin for defections

**Option 2: Republican-Led Conservative Coalition**
- Republicans (38) + Reform (11) + Libertarian (1) = 50 seats (tie)
- Would need Democratic defections to break tie
- Fiscal conservative agenda, limited social policy changes

**Option 3: Center-Reform Coalition**
- Democrats (42) + Reform (11) = 53 seats (clear majority)
- Mirrors House coalition structure
- Mixed progressive social policy with fiscal discipline

**Option 4: Grand Coalition**
- Democrats (42) + Republicans (38) + Reform (11) = 91 seats (supermajority)
- Could overcome filibusters (60 votes) easily
- Would require major compromise but could pass significant legislation

The negotiations played out publicly, following the model established by the House coalition in 1997. Each party published its priorities and red lines. Town halls were held. Constituent preferences were surveyed.

By December 1998, the Senate had settled on **Option 3: Center-Reform Coalition**, mirroring the House structure. The coalition agreement included:

**Leadership:**
- Majority Leader: Tom Daschle (D-South Dakota)
- Whip: Thomas Anderson (Reform-Kansas)
- President Pro Tempore: Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia)

**Committee Chairs:**
- Distributed proportionally: Democrats 12, Republicans 6, Reform 2
- Reform Party received Agriculture and Small Business committees, reflecting rural/populist base

**Policy Commitments:**
- Constitutional amendment for nationwide presidential RCV (Electoral College reform)
- Campaign finance reform strengthening 1997 House legislation
- Healthcare prescription drug expansion
- Agricultural support for small farms and cooperatives
- Renewable energy tax credits extension
- Balanced budget maintenance with productivity/recession exceptions

**Coalition Rules:**
- Major legislation requires support from at least 2 of 3 coalition parties
- Filibuster reform: 55 votes for cloture (down from 60), encouraging compromise
- Minority Republicans guaranteed committee representation and amendment rights

The coalition had 53 votes, enough to pass legislation without filibusters if unified, but requiring genuine negotiation to maintain cohesion.

## How the Senate Changed

The transformation of the Senate went beyond numbers. The culture and operation of the chamber shifted in subtle but significant ways:

**Deliberation Over Obstruction:** Under two-party control, the minority party's role was often purely obstructionist—block everything, make the majority fail, win the next election. Under coalition governance with multiple parties, pure obstruction was less effective. If Republicans blocked legislation, Democrats and Reform could negotiate around them. If Reform demanded changes, Democrats could negotiate with moderate Republicans instead. The incentive shifted from obstruction to participation.

Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), a moderate Republican not in the coalition but working with it on specific legislation, explained the shift: "Under two-party control, I had to choose between my party and my conscience on every vote. Now I can work with the coalition on things where I agree and work with Republicans where I don't. The binary choice is gone. That's liberating."

**Long-Term Thinking:** Six-year terms had always given Senators more freedom to think beyond the next election. Coalition governance amplified this. Senators in the coalition knew their constituents had often ranked them second or third alongside their first choice. They'd been elected to govern in coalition, not to fight partisan warfare. This created space for legislation that took years to show results—infrastructure investment, educational reform, renewable energy transitions.

Senator Anderson captured this in a March 1999 speech: "I represent Kansas farmers who put wind turbines on their land in the 1980s and saw benefits accumulate over decades. That's how I think about legislation. Not 'will this help me win in 2004?' but 'will this help Kansas in 2020?' Coalition governance enables that long-term thinking because I'm not in a zero-sum partisan battle. I'm in a cooperative effort to make things better."

**Regional Over Partisan:** The Senate had always represented states more than parties, but two-party dominance had obscured that. Multi-party politics brought regional interests back to the foreground. The 11 Reform Senators represented agricultural and small industrial states across geographic regions. They caucused together not because of party discipline, but because they shared constituent interests—cooperative agriculture, rural broadband, renewable energy in farming communities, small business protection.

Similarly, the 6 Green Senators represented progressive urban/suburban constituencies regardless of region. Vermont and Hawaii had little in common geographically, but their voters wanted aggressive climate action, environmental protection, and social justice. The Green caucus reflected that.

**Expertise Over Seniority:** Committee assignments under coalition governance emphasized expertise over pure seniority. Senator Anderson, a first-term Senator, received the Agriculture Committee chair because he was a farmer who ran a wind cooperative. His expertise mattered more than his seniority. Senator Sanders received the Energy Committee chair despite being newly elected to the Senate (though he had House experience) because of his decades advocating for renewable energy.

This shift frustrated senior Senators who had waited years for chairmanships. But it improved legislative quality. People who understood industries and issues firsthand shaped the legislation governing them.

## The First Year of Coalition Senate

The 106th Congress (1999-2000) saw the Senate coalition operate similarly to the House coalition—negotiate consensus items, pass those first, work on contentious issues through subcommittees, table items that couldn't generate 53 votes.

**January-March 1999:** Agricultural Support and Cooperative Expansion Act passed 58-42. Expanded OPC credit for agricultural cooperatives from 2.5% to 2.0%, created grant programs for farmer-led renewable energy projects, provided technical assistance for cooperative formation. Coalition voted yes (53), plus 5 additional Senators from agricultural states.

**April-May 1999:** Healthcare Prescription Drug Expansion Act passed 61-39. Built on 1997 House legislation, adding mental health parity, increasing generic drug availability, expanding Medicare to cover those 55-64 years old (early Medicare). Coalition voted yes, plus 8 additional Senators representing states with older populations.

**June-August 1999:** Electoral College Reform Amendment passed 67-33, meeting the 2/3 threshold for constitutional amendments. Proposed amending the Constitution to allocate electoral votes via Ranked Choice Voting within each state (states already doing this could continue), with a national popular vote ranked choice backstop if no candidate received 270 electoral votes. Required ratification by 38 states (3/4) by 2004.

The amendment was the crown jewel of the electoral reform movement. It would make presidential elections genuinely democratic while preserving the Electoral College structure (satisfying small states worried about losing influence) but eliminating the winner-take-all distortion that made some states irrelevant.

Senator Anderson's speech supporting the amendment captured the moment:

"In 1992, Ross Perot won 32% of the national popular vote and zero electoral votes. Thirty-two million Americans voted for him—more than voted for President Bush—and their votes translated to zero representation in the Electoral College. That's not democracy. That's a rigged system.

"This amendment preserves the Electoral College but makes it democratic. Each state allocates its electoral votes using Ranked Choice Voting. If you're in Texas and you want to vote Green first and Democrat second, you can. If you're in California and you want to vote Libertarian first and Republican second, you can. Your preferences count. Your vote matters. Nobody's a spoiler.

"We've proven this works. Five states used RCV for president in 1992. Forty-eight states used it for House elections in 1996. Every state but two used it for House and Senate in 1998. We know it works. Let's make it permanent. Let's make it national. Let's make presidential elections actually democratic."

The amendment passed with bipartisan support—all coalition members, plus 14 additional Senators who represented RCV states or swing states that would benefit from being competitive rather than being taken for granted in winner-take-all contests.

**September-December 1999:** Budget negotiations and routine legislation. The coalition maintained fiscal discipline—balanced budget with productivity adjustments—while funding priorities: renewable energy expansion, universal broadband deployment, infrastructure maintenance, educational investment.

By the end of 1999, the Senate coalition had proven as functional as the House coalition. Legislative productivity remained high. Approval ratings for Congress stood at 62%—the highest since polling began in the 1970s.

## The Contrast

The path not taken saw a very different Senate in 1998-1999. Republicans would expand their majority to 55-45, setting the stage for the Clinton impeachment trial to become a purely partisan spectacle. Gridlock would increase. Legislative productivity would decline. Approval ratings would sink.

Here, the impeachment trial (which still occurred—Clinton's personal scandals were unaffected by electoral systems) played out differently. With six parties in the Senate, the trial couldn't be purely partisan. Reform and Green Senators, not beholden to Democratic party loyalty, split on the charges. Some voted to convict on perjury, others acquitted on all charges. The final votes reflected genuine deliberation rather than party-line discipline:

**Article I (Perjury): 51 Guilty, 49 Not Guilty** (short of 67 needed to convict)
- Republicans 38 guilty, 0 not guilty
- Democrats 2 guilty, 40 not guilty  
- Reform 6 guilty, 5 not guilty
- Green 3 guilty, 3 not guilty
- Labor 1 guilty, 1 not guilty
- Libertarian 1 guilty, 0 not guilty

**Article II (Obstruction): 44 Guilty, 56 Not Guilty**
- Republicans 38 guilty, 0 not guilty
- Democrats 0 guilty, 42 not guilty
- Reform 3 guilty, 8 not guilty
- Green 2 guilty, 4 not guilty
- Labor 0 guilty, 2 not guilty
- Libertarian 1 guilty, 0 not guilty

Clinton was acquitted, but not along purely partisan lines. The trial demonstrated that multi-party politics could handle constitutional crises with more nuance than two-party warfare.

More importantly, the impeachment didn't consume all political oxygen the way it did in the path not taken. The Senate coalition continued passing legislation even during the trial. Coalition governance proved resilient.

## Looking to 2000

As 1999 ended, attention turned to the 2000 elections—particularly the presidential race. For the first time, nearly all states would use Ranked Choice Voting for president. The Electoral College Reform Amendment was working its way through state legislatures for ratification. Multi-party democracy was about to be tested at the highest level.

The candidates were already preparing:
- Vice President Al Gore (Democrat)
- Governor George W. Bush (Republican) 
- Ralph Nader (Green Party)
- Ross Perot (Reform Party, running again at 69 years old)
- Pat Buchanan (Conservative Party, split from Republicans)
- Harry Browne (Libertarian Party)

A six-way race. In the path not taken, this would create chaos, controversy, and constitutional crisis (as the 2000 election did with just Bush vs. Gore vs. Nader). Here, RCV would deliver a clear winner with legitimate majority support after preference redistribution.

The question wasn't whether democracy would work—RCV states and districts had proven it would. The question was what kind of government the American people would choose when given real choices.

The answer would come on November 7, 2000.
