# Chapter 5: Corporate America Without Leverage

## 5.3 Wages and Productivity: The Coupling That Held

### The Great Decoupling: What Didn't Happen Here

In our timeline, one of the most devastating economic divergences began in 1973:

**The Pattern (Our Timeline):**
- **1945-1973:** Productivity and wages rose together (+96% productivity, +91% wages)
- **1973-2024:** Productivity continued rising, wages stagnated (+77% productivity, +12% wages)
- **Result:** Workers produced more, earned less. Profits flowed to capital, not labor.

This "Great Decoupling" was the central mechanism of the Heist—the way the Ownership Class captured all productivity gains while workers fell behind.

In this timeline, **the coupling held**.

Productivity and wages rose together, 1945-1965 and beyond.

Not through good intentions. Through **architecture**.

### Why Wages Tracked Productivity: The Structural Mechanisms

**Mechanism 1: No Leverage for Union-Busting**

In our timeline, corporations broke unions through:
- Hiring replacement workers during strikes (expensive, but funded by debt)
- Moving factories to anti-union regions (capital to build new facilities from debt)
- Lobbying for anti-labor laws (funded by extraction)

**This Timeline:**

**No Debt for Union-Breaking:**
- Corporations couldn't borrow to fund strikebreaking
- OPC wouldn't finance anti-union activity (not productive)
- Banks (as utilities) couldn't create credit for labor suppression

**Moving Factories Was Harder:**
- Closing productive facility required OPC approval (if company had outstanding credit)
- Worker board representatives could challenge closures
- Community economic protections (1956 Act) created legal barriers

**Result:** Unions remained strong
- 1965 union density: 52% (vs. 28% in our timeline)
- Unions could negotiate wages tracking productivity
- Strike threat remained credible (companies couldn't easily break strikes)

**Mechanism 2: Worker Board Representation**

By 1965, 68% of large corporations (>500 employees) had worker representatives on boards.

**How This Affected Wages:**

**Traditional Board (Our Timeline):**
- All directors elected by shareholders
- Optimize for shareholder value
- Wages = cost to minimize

**Mixed Board (This Timeline):**
- Majority elected by shareholders
- 2-4 seats held by worker representatives
- Wages = both cost *and* livelihood of board members

**Example: General Motors Board Meeting (1962)**

**Agenda Item:** Capital allocation for next year
- Option A: Invest in automation (save labor costs, boost profits)
- Option B: Share productivity gains with workers (raise wages)

**Our Timeline Outcome:**
- Board votes for automation
- Workers laid off
- Wages stagnate
- Profits rise

**This Timeline Debate:**

**Shareholder Directors:** "Automation increases productivity 18%. We should maximize this for shareholders."

**Worker Directors:** "Automation also eliminates 4,200 jobs. We propose: automate, *and* use some productivity gains to increase wages for remaining workers by 12%. Everyone benefits."

**The Vote:**
- 9 shareholder directors: Split (5 for worker proposal, 4 against)
- 3 worker directors: All for worker proposal
- **Result: 8-4, wage increase approved**

**Why Some Shareholder Directors Voted for Worker Proposal:**

1. **Pragmatism:** Workers threatened strike if wages didn't rise
2. **Retention:** Wage increases reduced turnover (saved training costs)
3. **Demand:** Higher wages = more consumer spending = more GM car sales

**Result:** Productivity gains shared, not hoarded.

**Mechanism 3: Profit-Sharing Plans**

By 1965, 46% of large corporations had profit-sharing plans.

**How Profit-Sharing Worked:**

**Structure:**
- Annual profit pool calculated (typically 10-15% of profits)
- Distributed to workers based on salary/tenure
- Paid as bonuses (not base wage)

**Example: Ford Motor Company (1960):**
- Profits: $480 million
- Profit-sharing pool: 12% = $57.6 million
- 120,000 workers
- Average bonus: $480 (8% of median worker salary)

**Why This Mattered:**

**Our Timeline:**
- Profits went to shareholders/executives
- Workers got wage (fixed, regardless of company performance)

**This Timeline:**
- Workers shared in success
- When productivity rose → profits rose → bonuses rose → worker income tracked productivity

**The Numbers (1960):**
- Companies with profit-sharing: Wages+bonuses averaged 18% higher than companies without
- Worker retention: 34% higher in profit-sharing companies

**Mechanism 4: No Stock Buyback Option**

This is crucial. In our timeline, the 1982 SEC Rule 10b-18 legalized stock buybacks, enabling corporations to use profits to inflate stock prices instead of raising wages.

**Our Timeline (1982-2024):**
- $7+ trillion spent on buybacks
- Artificially inflated stock prices
- Zero went to workers

**This Timeline:**

**Stock Buybacks Were Never Legalized** because:

1. **No Pressure for Them:** Without leverage/LBOs, no activist shareholders demanding buybacks
2. **Alternative Uses:** Profits went to R&D, expansion, wages (productive uses)
3. **Structural Prevention:** OPC credit covenants prohibited using credit-purchased assets for financial engineering

**Result:** Profits that in our timeline would've been siphoned into buybacks instead went to wages, investment, dividends.

**Mechanism 5: Strong Minimum Wage**

The federal minimum wage remained economically meaningful.

**Our Timeline:**
- 1956 minimum: $1/hour ($11.20 in 2024 dollars)
- 1965 minimum: $1.25/hour ($12.20 in 2024 dollars)
- 2024 minimum: $7.25 (declined 41% in real terms since peak)

**This Timeline:**
- 1956 minimum: $1.10/hour ($12.32 in 2024 dollars)
- 1965 minimum: $1.60/hour ($15.60 in 2024 dollars)
- Indexed to productivity (automatic annual adjustment)

**Why Stronger Minimum Wage?**

**Political Economy:**
- Strong unions lobbied for higher minimum
- Worker board representatives supported minimum wage increases
- No corporate debt to service (companies could afford higher wages)

**Economic Logic:**
- Higher minimum wage = more consumer demand
- Companies benefited from customers with spending power

**Impact:**
- Bottom 20% earnings: 42% higher than our timeline
- Reduced poverty rate
- Lifted all wages (even above minimum)

### The Numbers: Wages and Productivity 1945-1965

| Period | Productivity Growth | Wage Growth (This Timeline) | Wage Growth (Our Timeline) | Gap |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----|
| **1945-1950** | +24% | +22% | +18% | +4 pts |
| **1950-1955** | +18% | +16% | +14% | +2 pts |
| **1955-1960** | +14% | +13% | +11% | +2 pts |
| **1960-1965** | +22% | +20% | +16% | +4 pts |
| **TOTAL 1945-65** | +96% | +92% | +72% | +20 pts |

**The Pattern:** Wages tracked productivity almost 1:1.

**Median Worker Wage (1965):**
- This timeline: $8,400/year (2024: $82,000)
- Our timeline: $6,900/year (2024: $67,000)
- Difference: +22% ($15,000 in 2024 dollars)

### The Case Studies: Three Workers' Lives

**Margaret Thompson, Auto Worker (Detroit, 1945-1965)**

**1945:** Hired at GM, assembly line, $2,800/year

**1955:** 
- Base wage: $5,200 (tracked productivity)
- Profit-sharing bonus: $420
- Total: $5,620 (+101% from 1945)

**1965:**
- Base wage: $7,800 (continued tracking)
- Profit-sharing bonus: $680
- Total: $8,480 (+203% from 1945)
- Owns home (OPC mortgage, paid off 1963)
- Savings: $18,400
- Two kids in college (OPC education credit, 0% interest)

**Our Timeline Comparison (1965):**
- Wage: $6,200 (real terms, +121% from 1945)
- No profit-sharing
- Renting (never could afford home)
- Savings: $2,800
- Kids working, not college

**Difference:** Architecture of prosperity vs. extraction.

**Robert Martinez, Steel Worker (Pittsburgh, 1948-1965)**

**1948:** Hired at cooperative steel fabrication plant (converted 1953), $3,200/year

**1958 (5 years after cooperative conversion):**
- Base wage: $5,800
- Profit distribution (cooperative): $940
- Total: $6,740 (+111% from 1948)
- Worker-owner (voted on company decisions)

**1965:**
- Base wage: $8,200
- Profit distribution: $1,480
- Total: $9,680 (+203% from 1948)
- Cooperative equity stake: $14,200
- Owns home (paid off)
- Active in union, community

**Our Timeline Comparison:**
- Plant closed 1962 (owner sold to conglomerate, facility shuttered)
- Martinez laid off, never earned comparable wage again
- 1965: Working retail, $4,800/year
- Struggling

**Difference:** Ownership vs. disposability.

**Linda Chen, Textile Worker (North Carolina, 1950-1965)**

**1950:** Hired at garment factory, $2,200/year

**1960:**
- Factory threatened closure (owner wanted to move South to avoid unions)
- Workers organized buyout (OPC cooperative credit)
- Chen became worker-owner
- Base wage: $4,800
- Profit distribution: $380
- Total: $5,180 (+135% from 1950)

**1965:**
- Base wage: $6,400
- Profit distribution: $820
- Total: $7,220 (+228% from 1950)
- Cooperative thriving (orders strong)
- Elected to worker council
- Training younger workers

**Our Timeline Comparison:**
- Factory closed 1958 (moved to South Carolina, non-union)
- Chen unemployed 1958-1960
- 1965: Working part-time retail, $3,200/year
- Poverty

**Difference:** Community preservation vs. capital flight.

### The Sectors Where Coupling Was Strongest

Not all sectors saw equal wage-productivity coupling. Some industries had structural advantages.

**Strong Coupling Sectors:**

**1. Manufacturing:**
- Union density: 68%
- Worker board representation: 72% of large firms
- Productivity growth: +112% (1945-65)
- Wage growth: +108%
- Coupling: 96%

**2. Transportation:**
- Union density: 84%
- Productivity growth: +88%
- Wage growth: +84%
- Coupling: 95%

**3. Construction:**
- Union density: 78%
- Productivity growth: +76%
- Wage growth: +72%
- Coupling: 95%

**Weaker Coupling Sectors:**

**1. Retail:**
- Union density: 24%
- Productivity growth: +64%
- Wage growth: +48%
- Coupling: 75%

**2. Services:**
- Union density: 18%
- Productivity growth: +42%
- Wage growth: +32%
- Coupling: 76%

**The Pattern:** Union strength = wage-productivity coupling strength.

### The Executive Compensation That Didn't Explode

Another critical divergence: Executive pay remained reasonable.

**CEO Pay Ratio (CEO:Average Worker):**

| Year | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| 1950 | 18:1 | 20:1 | -2 |
| 1955 | 21:1 | 24:1 | -3 |
| 1960 | 24:1 | 28:1 | -4 |
| 1965 | 28:1 | 32:1 | -4 |
| (2024 projection) | 42:1 | 350:1 | -308 |

**Why Executive Pay Stayed Reasonable:**

**1. No Stock Options Culture:**
- Stock options (as compensation) weren't common
- Executives paid salary + modest bonuses
- No incentive to manipulate stock price

**2. Worker Board Representatives:**
- Executive compensation required board approval
- Worker directors questioned excessive pay
- Created cultural norm of restraint

**3. No LBO/Raider Culture:**
- In our timeline, executives feared raiders (hostile takeovers)
- Demanded golden parachutes, stock options as protection
- In this timeline: No raiders = no fear = less executive leverage

**4. Cooperative Comparison:**
- Cooperatives had pay ratio caps (3:1 to 7:1)
- Created comparison point ("Why does traditional CEO earn 30x when cooperative manager earns 6x?")
- Cultural pressure for moderation

**Example: General Electric CEO (1965):**

**This Timeline:**
- CEO salary: $240,000
- Average worker: $8,600
- Ratio: 28:1

**Our Timeline:**
- CEO salary: $280,000
- Average worker: $6,800
- Ratio: 41:1

**By 2024 (Our Timeline):**
- GE CEO: $21 million
- Average worker: $68,000
- Ratio: 309:1

**The Divergence:** Executive compensation explosion prevented at source.

### The Consumer Economy: Wage-Driven Demand

Higher wages created virtuous cycle.

**The Mechanism:**

**1. Workers Earned More:**
- Wages tracked productivity
- Profit-sharing added income
- Low housing costs (OPC mortgages) freed spending

**2. Workers Spent More:**
- Consumer spending: 68% of GDP (1965)
- Broad-based demand (not just wealthy)

**3. Companies Sold More:**
- Higher sales = higher profits
- Justified further wage increases

**4. Cycle Repeated**

**The Numbers (1965):**

**Consumer Spending by Income Quintile:**

| Income Group | Spending (This Timeline) | Spending (Our Timeline) | Difference |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Bottom 20% | $3,200/household | $2,400/household | +33% |
| Second 20% | $5,800/household | $4,600/household | +26% |
| Middle 20% | $8,200/household | $6,800/household | +21% |
| Fourth 20% | $11,400/household | $9,800/household | +16% |
| Top 20% | $18,200/household | $17,200/household | +6% |

**The Pattern:** Spending gains concentrated in bottom 80% (where wage gains were largest).

**Macroeconomic Impact:**

**GDP Growth (1945-1965):**
- This timeline: 4.8% annual average
- Our timeline: 4.2% annual average
- Difference: +0.6 percentage points

**Why Faster Growth?**

**Demand-Side:**
- Broader consumer base (more people with spending power)
- Less income hoarded (bottom 80% spend higher % of income than top 20%)

**Supply-Side:**
- Companies invested in production (serving broad demand)
- R&D spending higher (3.2% revenue vs. 2.4%)

**Result:** Faster, more stable growth.

### The Inflation That Didn't Spiral

Skeptics argued: "If wages rise with productivity, won't inflation explode?"

**The Evidence:** No.

**Inflation Rate (1945-1965):**
- This timeline: 2.8% annual average
- Our timeline: 2.6% annual average
- Difference: +0.2 percentage points (negligible)

**Why Inflation Remained Low Despite Higher Wages:**

**1. Productivity Gains Covered Wage Gains:**
- When productivity rises 20% and wages rise 20%, unit labor costs stay flat
- No inflationary pressure

**2. No Credit-Driven Demand Shocks:**
- Consumer credit limited (no credit cards)
- Housing credit at 0.5% (no speculation bubbles)
- Demand grew steadily with real wages, not debt

**3. OPC Credit Discipline:**
- Public credit issued only for productive purposes
- No speculative bubbles to burst

**4. Competitive Markets:**
- No mega-conglomerates with pricing power
- Companies competed on quality/price
- Profit margins reasonable (9.8% average)

**Result:** Wage growth + price stability.

### The Anti-Friedman Doctrine: What Never Took Root

In our timeline, the 1970 Milton Friedman essay ("The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits") became corporate gospel—justification for wage suppression, layoffs, extraction.

**In This Timeline:**

The doctrine never gained traction because:

**1. Structural Reality Contradicted It:**
- Companies with worker board seats couldn't pursue pure shareholder value
- Cooperatives proved stakeholder model worked (higher productivity)
- Profit-sharing companies outperformed

**2. Cultural Norm:**
- Stakeholder capitalism was lived reality (not just rhetoric)
- "Shareholder primacy" sounded radical, not sensible

**3. Academic Challenge:**
- When Friedman published similar ideas (1968, this timeline), counter-essays immediately appeared
- "Productivity comes from workers. Workers deserve share of gains. This is economics, not charity."

**4. No Crisis to Exploit:**
- In our timeline, 1970s stagflation created opening for Friedman/neoliberalism
- In this timeline: No stagflation (addressed in later chapter), no opening

**Result:** Stakeholder model remained dominant corporate philosophy.

### The Bargaining Power Balance: Labor vs. Capital

Underlying the wage-productivity coupling was fundamental shift in bargaining power.

**Our Timeline:**
- Capital = scarce (controlled access to credit)
- Labor = abundant (workers competed for jobs)
- Result: Capital had power, suppressed wages

**This Timeline:**
- Capital = accessible (OPC credit available)
- Labor = valuable (productivity gains required worker cooperation)
- Result: Balanced power, wages tracked productivity

**The Mechanism:**

**Workers Had Credible Alternatives:**
1. Form cooperative (OPC credit available at 2.5%)
2. Buy out employer (worker board representation enabled)
3. Strike (unions strong, companies couldn't easily break strikes)

**Companies Had to Negotiate:**
- Couldn't break unions (no leverage)
- Couldn't offshore (community protections, credit covenants)
- Needed workers (productivity required cooperation)

**Result:** Good-faith bargaining replaced extraction.

### The Numbers Summary: 1945-1965 Wage-Productivity Coupling

| Indicator | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Productivity growth** | +96% | +96% | 0% (same) |
| **Wage growth** | +92% | +72% | +20 pts |
| **Coupling rate** | 96% | 75% | +21 pts |
| **Union density** | 52% | 28% | +24 pts |
| **Profit-sharing companies** | 46% | 22% | +24 pts |
| **Worker board representation** | 68% | 0% | +68 pts |
| **CEO:Worker pay ratio** | 28:1 | 32:1 | -4 |
| **Median wage (2024 $)** | $82,000 | $67,000 | +22% |
| **Bottom 20% wage gains** | +108% | +68% | +40 pts |
| **Inflation** | 2.8% | 2.6% | +0.2 pts |

**The Story in Numbers:** Productivity shared, not hoarded.

### What the Coupling Proved

**1. Wages Can Track Productivity:**
- Not inevitable that they diverge
- Structural choices determine distribution

**2. Strong Labor = Broad Prosperity:**
- Unions, worker boards, cooperatives gave workers bargaining power
- Power translated to wages tracking productivity

**3. Wage Growth ≠ Inflation:**
- When productivity rises with wages, no inflationary pressure
- Friedman/monetarist fears unfounded

**4. Executive Restraint Is Possible:**
- Without stock options culture and raider threat, executive pay stayed reasonable
- Cultural norms mattered, but structure enforced them

**5. Architecture Determines Distribution:**
- Same productivity gains
- Different structures
- Different outcomes

In our timeline, productivity gains went to capital (owners, executives).

In this timeline, productivity gains went to labor (workers).

Same pie. Different slices.

**Architecture determined who ate.**
