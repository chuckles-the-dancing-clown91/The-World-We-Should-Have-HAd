# 9.1 The Businessman Who Spoke Plain

*June 1992*

Ross Perot didn't look like a revolutionary. The billionaire from Texas with the crew cut and the charts spoke in the clipped cadence of a successful businessman, not the soaring rhetoric of a movement leader. But when he appeared on cable news in early 1992, holding up his hand-drawn graphs about the national debt and the trade deficit, millions of Americans saw something they hadn't seen in a long time: someone who seemed to be telling them the truth.

In another timeline, Perot's 1992 independent presidential campaign would be remembered as a colorful footnote—19% of the vote, the best third-party showing since 1912, but ultimately changing nothing. The two-party duopoly would absorb the shock and continue as before. His supporters would return to their partisan corners, their protest registered but their influence nullified.

This timeline was different. Not because Perot was different—he ran nearly the same campaign, hit the same themes, exhibited the same quirks and paranoia—but because the ground he was running on had been prepared by thirty years of democratic experimentation.

Twenty-eight cities and five states had been using Ranked Choice Voting for years. Millions of Americans had direct experience with ranking their preferences rather than being forced to choose between two options. Coalition governance was normal in Berkeley, Cambridge, Burlington. Multi-party councils operated in Ann Arbor, Madison, Santa Fe. The very existence of these experiments proved that democracy could function beyond the binary.

More fundamentally, economic security freed people to take political risks. When homeownership was accessible via 0.5% OPC mortgages, when education was debt-free via 0% OPC credit, when 52% of workers belonged to unions and 17% owned their cooperatives, when median household wealth was $268,000 rather than $152,000—people could afford to vote their actual preferences rather than their fears.

The political system was the last major institution that hadn't been democratized. The economy operated on cooperative principles. Energy infrastructure was owned by farmer cooperatives and municipal utilities. Computing platforms were worker-governed. Broadband was a public utility. 

But the presidency? That was still chosen by a system that forced voters to pick between two pre-selected options, with spoiler effects and strategic voting distorting preferences. Congress? Same story. The disconnect was becoming glaring.

Perot walked into that gap. He didn't create the demand for political alternatives—the demand had been building for years as voters experienced democratic governance in their workplaces, their energy cooperatives, their municipal broadband utilities, and asked why their federal government remained a duopoly. But he gave that demand a voice, a face, and a candidacy that forced the major parties to respond.

## The Campaign That Caught Fire

Perot announced his candidacy on February 20, 1992, on CNN's "Larry King Live." The announcement itself was unconventional—no prepared speech, no campaign apparatus, just a businessman saying he'd run if volunteers got him on the ballot in all fifty states.

"I'll run on one condition," Perot said, his Texas twang unmistakable. "You, the people, put me on the ballot in all fifty states. Not me—you. If you want me to run, you do the work. If you don't, I'll stay home and mind my own business."

In another timeline, this would have been a long shot that somehow worked, generating 19% of the vote through grassroots enthusiasm alone. Here, it was still a long shot, but the infrastructure for independent organizing already existed. The same networks that had built municipal broadband cooperatives, organized farmer-owned wind projects, and campaigned for RCV in five states turned their attention to getting Perot on the ballot.

Within three months, volunteers had collected the necessary signatures in all fifty states. Perot was in.

His message resonated across traditional partisan lines. The deficit and debt—$4 trillion in 1992—needed to be addressed. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would create "a giant sucking sound" of jobs moving to Mexico if it didn't include labor and environmental protections. Political reform was essential: term limits, campaign finance reform, and most importantly, electoral system reform to break the two-party stranglehold.

"The American people are smart enough to govern themselves," Perot said at a rally in Dallas in May. "The problem isn't the people. It's a system that gives you two choices, both of them picked by party insiders and funded by big money. You want more choices? Well, in some cities and states, you already have them. Ranked Choice Voting. Municipal broadband decided by referendum, not corporate lobbying. Worker cooperatives governed democratically. Why can't we run the federal government the same way?"

The question hung in the air. Twenty million people were watching. They'd heard about RCV in Portland and Madison. They'd read about the municipal broadband success in Chattanooga. Some worked at cooperative factories or belonged to wind farming co-ops. They knew that democratic alternatives existed and worked.

So why *couldn't* they run the federal government that way?

## The Three-Way Race

By June 1992, national polling showed a three-way race: President George H.W. Bush at 32%, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton at 34%, and Ross Perot at 28%. In another timeline, these numbers would generate panic among political operatives about "spoilers" and "splitting the vote." Third-party candidates were supposed to be marginal protest votes, not viable contenders.

But the discourse here was different. The question wasn't "Which of the two real candidates do you support?" It was "How would you rank all three?"

The major newspapers in RCV states ran polls asking voters to rank their preferences. The results were fascinating:

**Maine (RCV state):**
- First choice: Clinton 36%, Bush 32%, Perot 30%, other 2%
- Second choice among Perot voters: Clinton 52%, Bush 44%, exhausted 4%
- Projected RCV winner: Clinton with 51.6% after Perot elimination and redistribution

**Vermont (RCV state):**
- First choice: Clinton 42%, Perot 28%, Bush 27%, other 3%
- Second choice among Perot voters: Clinton 58%, Bush 38%, exhausted 4%
- Projected RCV winner: Clinton with 54.4%

**Minnesota (RCV state):**
- First choice: Clinton 38%, Perot 31%, Bush 29%, other 2%
- Second choice among Perot voters: Clinton 48%, Bush 48%, exhausted 4%
- Projected RCV winner: Clinton with 52.8%

The pattern held across RCV jurisdictions: Perot voters had real second-choice preferences, and they could express them without fear of "spoiling" the election. The conversation shifted from "You're wasting your vote" to "Who's your second choice?"

In non-RCV states, the dynamic was more complicated. The spoiler effect still operated. Perot voters who preferred Clinton to Bush worried that supporting Perot would elect Bush. Perot voters who preferred Bush to Clinton had the mirror concern. Strategic voting was rampant.

But even there, the discourse was changing. Local newspapers editorialized about the difference between RCV states, where three-way races were manageable, and plurality states, where they created chaos. Academic studies from political scientists in Maine, Vermont, and Minnesota showed that voter satisfaction increased when people could rank candidates.

The demand for electoral reform—latent for years—became explicit.

## The Debates

The Presidential Debate Commission, controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties, initially announced that Perot would not be included in the debates. To qualify, they said, a candidate needed to poll at 15% nationally.

Perot was polling at 28%.

The commission revised its criteria: to qualify, a candidate needed a "realistic chance" of winning the Electoral College. Since Perot wasn't expected to win any states outright, they argued, he had no realistic chance.

The backlash was immediate and fierce. Newspapers in RCV states ran editorials asking why candidates who polled above 25% were being excluded from debates. Governors in Maine, Vermont, and Minnesota sent a joint letter to the commission arguing that their voters deserved to hear from all major candidates. Civic organizations that had spent years organizing for RCV mobilized.

The commission backed down. Perot would debate.

The first presidential debate, held October 11, 1992, in St. Louis, drew 89 million viewers—a record. The three-way format was electric. Bush defended his record on the economy and foreign policy. Clinton outlined his vision for healthcare reform and economic revitalization. Perot wielded his charts and spoke in plain language about problems that the other two candidates danced around.

"Now I want to show you this," Perot said, holding up a chart of federal debt growth. "See this line? That's our national debt. It goes up under Democrats, it goes up under Republicans. Why? Because the system is designed to avoid hard choices. Both parties promise everything, pay for nothing, and stick future generations with the bill.

"In places like Chattanooga, the city runs its own broadband utility and it works great—better service, lower prices, accountable to voters. Why? Because it's not designed to generate profits for distant shareholders. It's designed to serve people. Same with the Office of Public Credit—0.5% mortgages for housing, 0% for education. Works great because it's not designed to extract maximum profit. It's designed to serve the public.

"Why can't the federal government operate the same way? Not to make profits, but to serve people efficiently?"

Clinton responded by defending his economic plan. Bush defended his foreign policy record. But the question lingered.

The second debate, October 15 in Richmond, Virginia, used a town hall format. A woman in the audience asked all three candidates how the national debt had affected them personally.

Bush, a patrician from a wealthy family, stumbled through an answer about interest rates. Clinton talked about seeing struggling families in Arkansas. Perot said, "I haven't been affected personally. I'm a billionaire. But I've talked to thousands of Americans who work harder every year and fall further behind. You want to know what affects me? Watching a country I love make choices that hurt regular people while protecting the wealthy and powerful."

It was the moment that defined the debate—perhaps the campaign. Perot, the billionaire who nonetheless spoke for regular Americans in language they could understand.

## The Economics of Security

Underneath the surface drama of the campaign, something more fundamental was happening. The economic security that this timeline's architecture provided was enabling political experimentation that would have been unthinkable in conditions of precarity.

Compare the two timelines in 1992:

**This Timeline:**
- Median household wealth: $268,000
- Homeownership rate: 71% (with 0.5% OPC mortgages)
- Student debt (national total): $18 billion
- Union membership: 52%
- Cooperative workforce: 17%
- Average work week: 34.2 hours
- Health insurance coverage: 92%

**The Path Not Taken:**
- Median household wealth: $152,000
- Homeownership rate: 64% (with mortgages averaging 8-10%)
- Student debt (national total): $186 billion (ten times higher)
- Union membership: 16% 
- Cooperative workforce: <1%
- Average work week: 39.1 hours
- Health insurance coverage: 86%

The difference in these numbers translated into a difference in political risk tolerance. When homeownership was secure via low-interest OPC credit, when education debt didn't exist, when union membership provided job security, when cooperative ownership gave workers a voice—people could afford to vote for candidates who challenged the status quo.

The same dynamic operated at the community level. Cities with municipal broadband cooperatives, farmer-owned wind projects, and local RCV had experience with democratic alternatives that worked. They weren't theoretical possibilities; they were lived realities. Vote for change? We already experienced positive change through democratic decision-making. Why not more?

Martha Chen, a 38-year-old nurse in Burlington, Vermont, explained it in an interview with the local paper: "I can afford to vote for Perot because I'm not terrified of what happens if the 'wrong' candidate wins. My mortgage is 0.5% through OPC—no bank is going to foreclose. My hospital is worker-governed—my job is secure. My kids' education will be debt-free. My municipal broadband is $28 a month and works great. I have the freedom to vote my conscience, not my fear."

This sentiment was widespread. The Perot campaign internal polling found that his strongest support came from:
- Union members in cooperative enterprises
- Residents of cities with municipal broadband
- Members of agricultural cooperatives (especially wind farming co-ops)
- Homeowners with OPC mortgages (0.5% rate)
- Parents with children in debt-free public universities

These were people with economic security and democratic experience. They'd seen that alternatives worked. They wanted more.

## The Close Three-Way Finish

Election night, November 3, 1992, saw returns that would have caused constitutional crisis in a plurality voting system. As the evening progressed, the national vote settled into an unprecedented three-way near-tie:

- Bill Clinton: 38.4%
- Ross Perot: 32.1%
- George H.W. Bush: 28.2%
- Other: 1.3%

In the path not taken, these numbers would have created chaos. Clinton would have won with 38.4% despite 60%+ of voters preferring someone else. The Electoral College would have amplified the distortion. Perot voters would have felt like "spoilers" who "threw the election" to Clinton. The two-party duopoly would have held, and nothing would have changed.

Here, the five RCV states provided a different model. In Maine, Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon, and Massachusetts—representing 27 electoral votes—ranked choice voting for presidential electors operated smoothly:

**Maine (4 electoral votes):**
- Round 1: Clinton 36.2%, Perot 30.8%, Bush 31.4%, Other 1.6%
- Round 2 (Other eliminated): Clinton 36.8%, Perot 31.2%, Bush 32.0%
- Round 3 (Perot eliminated): Clinton 52.4%, Bush 47.6%
- Winner: Clinton with 52.4% after three rounds

**Vermont (3 electoral votes):**
- Round 1: Clinton 42.1%, Perot 28.4%, Bush 27.8%, Other 1.7%
- Round 2 (Other eliminated): Clinton 42.6%, Perot 28.8%, Bush 28.6%
- Round 3 (Bush eliminated): Clinton 58.2%, Perot 41.8%
- Winner: Clinton with 58.2%

**Minnesota (10 electoral votes):**
- Round 1: Clinton 38.2%, Perot 31.6%, Bush 28.8%, Other 1.4%
- Round 2 (Other eliminated): Clinton 38.8%, Perot 32.0%, Bush 29.2%
- Round 3 (Bush eliminated): Clinton 54.8%, Perot 45.2%
- Winner: Clinton with 54.8%

The pattern held across all five RCV states: three-way races were resolved through ranked choice counting that revealed genuine majority preferences. Perot voters weren't "spoilers"—they were participants whose second choices were respected. Clinton won all five RCV states, but with legitimate majorities after preference redistribution, not 38% pluralities.

In the other 45 states using plurality voting, Clinton won the popular vote with 38.4% and 297 electoral votes—a majority of the Electoral College despite winning far less than a majority of votes. Bush came in third with 28.2% and 162 electoral votes. Perot, despite winning 32.1% of the national popular vote—more than Bush—won zero electoral votes under the winner-take-all system.

The duopoly had survived, but barely. And the contrast between the RCV states, where three-way races were resolved cleanly, and the plurality states, where distortion was rampant, couldn't have been clearer.

## The Morning After

The day after the election, editorial pages across the country ran variations on the same theme: "This Is Why We Need Electoral Reform."

The *Portland Press Herald* (Maine, RCV state): "Last night, Maine voters ranked their presidential preferences and the system delivered a clear result: Clinton won with 52.4% after three rounds of counting. Our neighbors in New Hampshire, using plurality voting, delivered Clinton with 39.1%—a decisive minority. Which result better represents the will of the people?"

The *Burlington Free Press* (Vermont, RCV state): "Three-way presidential races are unmanageable under plurality voting. They're routine and functional under Ranked Choice Voting. Vermont proved this last night. It's time for the nation to follow Vermont's lead."

The *Minneapolis Star Tribune* (Minnesota, RCV state): "Ross Perot won 32% of the national vote and zero electoral votes. This is not democracy. This is a duopoly protecting itself from competition. Ranked Choice Voting, used successfully in Minnesota and four other states, offers a path forward."

Even papers in non-RCV states picked up the theme. The *New York Times* ran an analysis: "In Five States, Ranked Choice Voting Delivers Clear Results in Three-Way Race." The *Washington Post*: "Electoral Reform Momentum Builds After Perot's Strong Showing."

But the most significant response came from Perot himself. Two days after the election, he held a press conference in Dallas.

"I want to thank the thirty-two million Americans who voted for me," he said. "You sent a message that the two-party system isn't working. Now I'm going to send one back: I'm not going away. I'm founding an organization—United We Stand America—to push for the reforms we talked about during this campaign.

"First on the list: electoral reform. Five states used Ranked Choice Voting in this election and it worked perfectly. Three-way races were resolved cleanly. Voters could express their full preferences. Nobody was a spoiler. That's how democracy should work.

"I'm calling on Congress to pass the Federal Ranked Choice Voting Act. Implement RCV for House elections starting in 1994, Senate elections starting in 1996, presidential elections starting in 2000. Give Americans real choices. End the duopoly."

The room erupted in applause. Thirty-two percent of voters—32.1 million Americans—had supported Perot. They weren't going away either.

The two-party duopoly had won this round. But the pressure for change had just begun.
