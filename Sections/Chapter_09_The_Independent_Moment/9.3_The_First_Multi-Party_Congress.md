# 9.3 The First Multi-Party Congress

*November 1996*

The 1996 House elections were supposed to be a normal midterm—the president's party loses seats, power shifts marginally, but the fundamental structure remains unchanged. That's what happened in the path not taken. Democrats lost a few seats, Republicans gained a few, and the two-party duopoly continued as it had for 140 years.

This election was different. Forty-eight states used Ranked Choice Voting for House races for the first time. Automatic ballot access meant that the Reform Party, Green Party, Libertarian Party, and newly-formed Labor Party were on the ballot in every district where they fielded candidates. Voters could rank their preferences without fear of "wasting" votes.

The results shocked the political establishment and validated everything the reformers had predicted.

## The Numbers

When the counting finished in early November—some districts required multiple rounds of tabulation as candidates were eliminated and votes redistributed—the 105th Congress looked like this:

**House of Representatives (435 seats total):**
- Democrats: 198 seats (45.5%)
- Republicans: 182 seats (41.8%)
- Reform Party: 31 seats (7.1%)
- Green Party: 14 seats (3.2%)
- Labor Party: 8 seats (1.8%)
- Libertarian Party: 2 seats (0.5%)

For the first time since the 1850s, neither major party held a majority of House seats. Coalition governance—normal in RCV cities and states—was coming to Congress.

The headlines captured the shock:

*The Washington Post*: "Multi-Party Era Begins: Neither Democrats Nor Republicans Control House"

*The New York Times*: "Ranked Choice Voting Delivers on Promise: Third Parties Win 55 Seats"

*The Wall Street Journal*: "Congress Faces Coalition Governance as Four Parties Hold Balance of Power"

The path not taken would see Republicans maintain their majority from 1994 through 2006—twelve years of single-party control. Here, the era of duopoly dominance ended after two years of RCV.

## How It Happened

The transformation wasn't uniform. It varied by region, demographics, and local political culture. But patterns emerged:

**Urban Progressive Districts:** The Green Party won 14 seats, concentrated in urban areas with strong environmental movements and existing cooperative economies. Berkeley, Cambridge, Burlington, Portland, Seattle, Madison—cities that had used municipal RCV for decades—now sent Green Party representatives to Congress. These weren't protest votes. They were deliberate choices by voters who ranked Green first, Democrat second, and Republican distant third. When the votes were counted, Greens won with 51-54% after redistribution.

Representative Sarah Chen, Green Party, Berkeley, California, explained her victory: "We didn't win by defeating Democrats. We won by building a coalition. I was ranked first by progressives, second by moderate Democrats who trusted me to work with their party, and even third by some Republicans who respected that I'd served on the city council for eight years and delivered results. That's how coalition governance works."

**Rural Reform Districts:** The Reform Party won 31 seats, concentrated in agricultural areas and small industrial cities. These were districts where Perot had run strongly in 1992, where farmer-owned wind cooperatives had transformed rural economics, where voters had experience with cooperative democracy. Reform Party candidates ran on fiscal responsibility, electoral reform, and economic populism that rejected both big government and big business.

Representative Thomas Anderson, Reform Party, Kansas 1st District, had been a wind cooperative farmer profiled in earlier coverage: "People here know that cooperatives work better than monopolies. They've lived it. Wind co-ops, grain co-ops, municipal broadband co-ops. So when I said Congress should operate the same way—democratic, accountable, serving people instead of parties—they got it. They ranked me first, then usually Republican second. I won with 53% after three rounds."

**Industrial Labor Districts:** The Labor Party won 8 seats in industrial areas with strong union histories and cooperative manufacturing. These were districts where 60-70% of workers belonged to unions, where worker board representation was standard, where cooperative governance was lived experience rather than abstract theory. Labor Party candidates explicitly ran on extending workplace democracy to political democracy.

Representative Maria Garcia, Labor Party, Michigan 13th District: "My district voted for a Democrat in the path we didn't take. But here, we had a choice. Democrats are labor-friendly, but they're still a big-tent party that includes corporate interests. The Labor Party represents workers, period. Voters ranked us first, Democrats second, and we won with 51% after Republicans were eliminated. That's democracy working—workers electing actual workers, not lawyers who are 'friends of labor.'"

**Libertarian-Conservative Districts:** The Libertarian Party won 2 seats in Western districts where small-government conservatism, gun rights, and social tolerance combined into a distinct political identity. These were districts where Republicans were too socially conservative and Democrats too economically progressive. Libertarians offered a third option.

Representative James Wilson, Libertarian Party, Montana At-Large: "Montana voters are libertarian with a small 'l'—we want government out of our bedrooms and our businesses. Republicans gave us the bedroom part but expanded government power in other ways. Democrats gave us social tolerance but wanted economic regulation. We offered both freedoms. Voters ranked us first, Republicans second usually, and we won with 52%."

## The Coalition Negotiations

The period between the November 5 election and the January 3, 1997 convening of the 105th Congress saw political dealmaking unprecedented in modern American history. With no party holding a majority, forming a governing coalition was essential.

In the path not taken, this would have created constitutional crisis. The system was built on the assumption of two-party competition with one party holding a majority. Coalition governance was alien to American political culture.

Here, it was expected. Twenty-eight cities and six states (Maine, Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Colorado, which adopted RCV in 1995) had been doing coalition governance for years. Academic studies documented how it worked. The precedents existed.

Three possible coalitions emerged:

**Option 1: Democratic-Led Progressive Coalition**
- Democrats (198) + Greens (14) + Labor (8) = 220 seats (majority)
- Policy focus: Environmental legislation, labor rights, healthcare expansion, progressive taxation
- Leadership: Dick Gephardt (D-Missouri) as Speaker

**Option 2: Republican-Led Conservative Coalition**  
- Republicans (182) + Reform (31) + Libertarians (2) = 215 seats (short of majority)
- Would need Democratic defections or additional parties
- Policy focus: Fiscal responsibility, regulatory reform, balanced budget
- Leadership: Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia) as Speaker

**Option 3: Center-Reform Coalition**
- Democrats (198) + Reform (31) = 229 seats (majority)
- Or: Republicans (182) + Reform (31) + Greens (14) + Labor (8) = 235 seats (larger majority)
- Policy focus: Electoral reform, fiscal responsibility, targeted social programs
- Leadership: Various possibilities

The negotiations happened publicly, in the tradition established by RCV cities and states. No backroom deals, no secret compromises. Representatives from each party held town halls, published position papers, and explained their coalition preferences to constituents.

The Reform Party, holding the balance of power, was courted by both sides. Their 31 seats could create a Democratic majority or a Republican majority. Their choice would determine the direction of the 105th Congress.

Representative Anderson, the wind farmer from Kansas and informal Reform Party leader, explained their calculation in a December speech:

"We're not looking for committee chairmanships or patronage. We're looking for policy commitments. Any coalition we join must commit to three priorities: (1) Continue RCV implementation for Senate and Presidential races. (2) Campaign finance reform that reduces the role of corporate money. (3) A balanced budget amendment with exceptions for recession and war, but enforced otherwise. Those are our terms. Democrats and Republicans both want our support. Fine. Commit to these three priorities in writing, and we'll negotiate."

## The Center-Reform Coalition

After six weeks of negotiation, a coalition emerged: Democrats (198) + Reform (31) + 6 moderate Republicans who agreed to support coalition governance = 235 seats, a functional majority.

The coalition agreement, published December 20, 1996, included:

**Governance Structure:**
- Speaker: Dick Gephardt (D-Missouri)
- Majority Leader: Jennifer Dunn (R-Washington) - moderate Republican joining coalition
- Whip: Ross Perot Jr. (Reform-Texas) - son of Ross Perot, elected from Dallas district
- Committee chairs distributed proportionally: Democrats 15, Republicans 4, Reform 3

**Policy Commitments:**
- RCV implementation for Senate (1998) and Presidential elections (2000) would proceed as scheduled
- Campaign finance reform bill to be introduced by March 1997, limiting corporate PAC contributions
- Balanced budget agreement by July 1997, with productivity and recession exceptions
- Healthcare reform addressing prescription drug costs and insurance coverage gaps
- Infrastructure investment including renewable energy and broadband expansion
- Minimum wage increase tied to inflation

**Coalition Rules:**
- Major legislation would require support from at least 2 of the 3 coalition parties
- Committee assignments proportional to seat share
- Minority Republicans guaranteed amendments and floor time on all major bills
- Coalition agreement to be renegotiated after 1998 midterms

The agreement represented genuine compromise. Democrats got healthcare reform and minimum wage increases. Republicans got fiscal responsibility and regulatory review. Reform got electoral and campaign finance reform. Nobody got everything, but everyone got something.

Representative Dunn, the moderate Republican who joined the coalition, explained her reasoning: "I can be in the minority and yell about Democratic overreach, or I can be in the coalition and shape policy. I chose to govern. That's what my constituents in Washington elected me to do."

Six other moderate Republicans made similar calculations, bringing the stable coalition to 241 votes—a comfortable governing majority.

## The Opposition

The 194 non-coalition members—176 Republicans, 12 Greens refusing to join a Democratic-led coalition, 4 Labor representatives taking the same stance, and 2 Libertarians—formed the opposition.

Representative Newt Gingrich, who in another timeline would be Speaker from 1995-1999, found himself leading a minority coalition. His reaction revealed the psychological adjustment that two-party dominance politicians faced:

"This is not how American democracy is supposed to work," Gingrich said in a January 1997 speech. "We have a two-party system. One party wins the majority, that party governs, and voters judge the results. Coalition governance is European. It leads to lowest-common-denominator policies and accountability problems."

The response from coalition members was pointed. Representative Wellstone: "We've used coalition governance in Minnesota for 20 years and it works great. Representative Gingrich is upset because he's not in charge. That's not a philosophical objection. That's sour grapes."

Representative Chen from Berkeley: "American democracy is 'supposed' to give voters real choices and deliver policies that reflect majority preferences. That's exactly what Ranked Choice Voting does. What it doesn't do is allow 38% minorities to govern like they're majorities. Representative Gingrich is mourning the loss of a system that distorted democracy in favor of party establishments."

The debate revealed the deeper tension. For politicians who had spent careers in the two-party duopoly, coalition governance felt illegitimate—a deviation from norms. For politicians who had experience with municipal and state RCV, coalition governance felt normal—the natural result of letting voters express their actual preferences.

## The First Hundred Days

The 105th Congress convened on January 3, 1997. The opening session looked different from any in modern history. Instead of two parties sitting on opposite sides of the chamber, six parties sat in rough ideological clusters:

- Far left: Greens (14) and Labor (8)
- Center-left: Democrats (198)
- Center: Reform (31) and moderate Republicans (7)
- Center-right: Remaining Republicans (175)
- Far right: Libertarians (2)

The seating arrangement visually represented the political spectrum in a way that the two-party system had obscured. Voters who wanted serious environmental action had elected Greens. Voters who wanted worker advocacy had elected Labor representatives. Voters who wanted fiscal responsibility without social conservatism had elected Reform. The system was representing the actual diversity of political preferences.

The first hundred days saw unprecedented legislative activity:

**February 1997:** Campaign Finance Reform Act passed 242-193. Limited corporate PAC contributions to $5,000 per candidate per cycle, expanded public financing for House races, required real-time disclosure of all contributions over $200. Coalition members voted yes (235), plus 7 non-coalition Republicans. Opposition came from Republicans who opposed limits on corporate speech and Greens who wanted more aggressive reforms.

**March 1997:** Balanced Budget Act passed 268-167. Required balanced budgets with exceptions for recession (GDP growth below 0% for 2 consecutive quarters) or war (declared by Congress). Coalition voted yes, plus 27 additional Republicans who supported fiscal discipline.

**April 1997:** Minimum Wage Act passed 238-197. Increased minimum wage from $4.75 to $5.85 over two years, with automatic inflation adjustments thereafter. Coalition voted yes, plus 3 non-coalition Labor and Green representatives. Republicans voted no except coalition members.

**May 1997:** Healthcare Prescription Drug Coverage Act passed 245-190. Added prescription drug coverage to Medicare, negotiated drug prices through federal bulk purchasing, capped out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 annually. Coalition voted yes, plus 10 additional representatives from both parties representing high-elderly districts.

**June 1997:** Infrastructure Investment Act passed 252-183. Authorized $84 billion over 5 years for renewable energy expansion, municipal broadband deployment, public transit, and water system upgrades. Coalition voted yes, plus 17 additional representatives from both parties representing districts with infrastructure needs.

The legislative productivity stood in stark contrast to the gridlock that characterized the path not taken. In that timeline, partisan warfare between Republican Congress and Democratic President would produce shutdowns, vetoes, and minimal legislation. Here, coalition governance required negotiation and compromise, but it produced results.

President Clinton, who had won re-election in 1996 with 43% in a four-way race (Clinton 43%, Republican Bob Dole 32%, Perot 22%, Green Ralph Nader 3%), worked with the coalition leadership. His signing statements emphasized the historic nature of the moment:

"For the first time in modern history, Congress represents the actual diversity of American political opinion. Not two parties pretending to represent everyone, but six parties representing distinct constituencies. And you know what? It works. We're passing legislation that addresses real problems. We're compromising without betraying principles. We're showing the world that democracy doesn't require duopoly."

## The Changed Discourse

Beyond the legislative outcomes, coalition governance changed how politics was discussed and understood.

**Media Coverage:** Political journalists had to adjust their frameworks. "Democrats vs. Republicans" was insufficient. Coverage had to account for six parties with distinct positions. The conventional "left-right" spectrum became visible in Congress instead of being compressed into two parties claiming to represent everyone.

The *Washington Post* hired a political scientist to create visualizations showing party positions on multiple axes: economic policy, social policy, foreign policy, environmental policy. Voters could see where parties actually stood, not where they claimed to stand.

**Voter Understanding:** Polling showed that voters developed more sophisticated political understanding under multi-party coalition governance. When asked "What do you think the Green Party stands for?", 72% could identify environmental protection and renewable energy. Under two-party duopoly, when asked "What do Democrats stand for?", only 48% could give specific answers beyond "liberal" or "left."

Multi-party politics forced clarity. Parties needed distinct identities to justify their existence. Voters benefited from that clarity.

**Coalition Thinking:** The culture of coalition governance spread beyond Congress. Municipal governments, state legislatures, even corporate boards began emphasizing coalition-building and compromise. The model proved that democracy could work without winner-take-all dominance.

Dr. Patricia Martinez, political scientist at the University of Minnesota who had studied RCV since the 1970s, published a widely-read analysis in June 1997:

"The 105th Congress is demonstrating what we've observed in RCV jurisdictions for decades: coalition governance produces more stable, more representative, and more satisfying results than duopoly governance. Legislation passes with genuine majority support rather than bare majorities often including members who voted yes for strategic reasons. Compromise is normal rather than evidence of betrayal. Voters see their actual preferences reflected in government rather than having to choose between two pre-selected bundles.

"The fear that multi-party democracy would lead to instability or gridlock has been empirically refuted. If anything, the 105th Congress has been more productive and less toxic than the partisan warfare that characterized 1995-1996. Coalition governance works."

## What Changed in Practice

The day-to-day operation of Congress under coalition governance looked different in small but significant ways:

**Committee Work:** With six parties represented proportionally, committees included genuinely diverse perspectives. The Energy and Commerce Committee included Democrats who supported environmental regulation, Republicans who emphasized market solutions, Greens who wanted aggressive climate action, and Reform members who focused on fiscal sustainability. Legislation that emerged from committee had already been through serious negotiation, making floor fights less intense.

**Amendments:** Under two-party control, amendments were often strategic weapons—designed to embarrass the other party or force tough votes rather than improve legislation. Under coalition governance, amendments were more often genuine attempts to improve bills, because coalition members needed to maintain working relationships across party lines.

**Messaging:** Two-party warfare relies on treating every issue as existential. Coalition governance required more nuanced messaging. Representatives had to explain why they voted yes on some parts of coalition agreements and no on others. Voters expected—and received—more sophisticated explanations.

**Relationships:** Representatives from different parties who served on the same committees or worked in the coalition developed genuine working relationships. Representative Anderson (Reform-Kansas) and Representative Dunn (R-Washington) co-sponsored legislation despite being in different parties. Representative Chen (Green-California) and Representative Garcia (Labor-Michigan) collaborated on environmental justice legislation despite coming from different caucuses.

These relationships weren't personal friendships necessarily, but they were professional partnerships. The incentive structure of coalition governance rewarded cooperation. The behavior followed.

## The Cities and States Show the Way

Throughout the transition to multi-party politics, the cities and states with longer RCV experience provided models and guidance.

Berkeley had been using RCV for 35 years by 1997. Its city council regularly included 4-5 parties. Coalition governance was so normal that residents would have found two-party dominance strange.

When the *San Francisco Chronicle* asked Berkeley Mayor Sarah Martinez (who had been elected via RCV coalition in 1976 and served as mayor 1986-1998) how Congress should navigate coalition governance, she laughed:

"You figure out what you all agree on and do that first. Then you figure out what 51% of you agree on and do that next. Then you figure out what issues need more time and you form working groups to negotiate. It's not complicated. It's democracy. You're elected to represent your constituents and find common ground with other representatives. RCV just makes that process honest instead of hiding everything behind primary elections and party control."

Her advice was widely circulated and followed. The 105th Congress operated almost exactly as she described—identify consensus areas, pass those quickly, negotiate on areas of disagreement, table issues that need more work.

Minnesota's state legislature, operating under RCV since 1978, sent a delegation to Washington in February 1997 to brief new Representatives on coalition governance mechanics. The briefing covered practical topics: how to negotiate coalition agreements, how to maintain coalition discipline without threatening to primary coalition members, how to manage opposition parties, how to explain votes to constituents.

Twenty-four members of Congress attended—Democrats, Republicans, and Reform members, all new to coalition governance. The Minnesota legislators' advice was consistent: "Trust the process. Your voters ranked you, they ranked your coalition partners second or third. They want you to work together. Do that, and they'll reward you."

## Looking Forward

By July 1997, six months into the 105th Congress, the evidence was clear: multi-party coalition governance worked at the federal level just as it had worked at municipal and state levels.

Approval ratings for Congress—usually abysmal in the path not taken, bottoming out around 15% by 2013—stood at 58% in July 1997, the highest level since the 1960s. Voters appreciated seeing their actual preferences represented and seeing Congress pass legislation that addressed real problems.

The 1998 Senate elections would use RCV for the first time. If the pattern from the House held, third parties would win Senate seats and coalition governance would extend to the upper chamber.

The 2000 presidential election would use RCV in most states (48 used it for House elections in 1996, and that number would grow to 50 by 2000). For the first time, voters would rank presidential candidates and a genuine multi-way race would be resolved through majority will rather than plurality distortion.

The two-party duopoly that had dominated American politics since the 1850s was over. Multi-party democracy had arrived. Coalition governance was the new normal.

And it worked better than what came before.
