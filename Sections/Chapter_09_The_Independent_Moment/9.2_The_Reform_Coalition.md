# 9.2 The Reform Coalition

*January 1993 - November 1994*

Bill Clinton took office in January 1993 with 297 electoral votes but only 38.4% of the popular vote—the most divided presidential mandate in modern American history. In another timeline, this would have been filed away as a political curiosity, and business would have proceeded as usual. The two-party duopoly would have held.

Not here. Perot's 32.1% showing and the obvious success of Ranked Choice Voting in five states had created political momentum that couldn't be ignored. United We Stand America—Perot's new organization—had 4.2 million members by February 1993, making it the largest grassroots political organization in the country. They had one demand: electoral reform.

The opening came faster than anyone expected.

## The Healthcare Reform Crisis

Clinton had campaigned on healthcare reform as his signature domestic priority. By September 1993, his administration had developed a comprehensive plan—universal coverage achieved through managed competition and employer mandates. It was intricate, bureaucratic, and politically vulnerable.

The plan died in Congress without ever coming to a vote. Republicans opposed it as government overreach. Progressive Democrats opposed it as too friendly to insurance companies. Conservative Democrats from rural states opposed it as too complicated and expensive. The coalition Clinton needed didn't exist.

In the path not taken, this failure would lead to Democratic losses in the 1994 midterms and a rightward political shift that would define the rest of the decade. Here, it led to a different realization: the problem wasn't the policy details. The problem was that the two-party system couldn't build the coalitions needed to address complex problems.

Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, a progressive Democrat, said it plainly during a November 1993 floor speech: "We couldn't pass healthcare reform not because Americans don't want it, but because our political system forces everything through a binary choice. You're either for the Democratic plan or the Republican plan. You're either socialist or heartless. There's no room for the coalition-building that actually works.

"I represent a state that uses Ranked Choice Voting. You know what we have in Minnesota? Coalition governance that functions. Multiple parties working together. Compromise that isn't considered betrayal. Maybe we need that here."

The speech went viral—by 1993 standards. C-SPAN viewership spiked. Newspapers reprinted the full text. United We Stand America sent copies to all 4.2 million members with a note: "This is what we're fighting for."

Three months later, Senator William Cohen of Maine, a moderate Republican, introduced the Federal Ranked Choice Voting Act.

## The Bill

The Federal Ranked Choice Voting Act of 1994 was simple—deliberately so. Five pages, compared to the hundreds of pages of failed healthcare legislation. Its provisions were straightforward:

**Section 1: House of Representatives**
- Beginning with the 1996 elections, all House races would use Ranked Choice Voting
- Voters would rank candidates in order of preference (minimum 3, maximum 5)
- If no candidate received a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes would be eliminated and their votes redistributed to voters' second choices
- This process would continue until a candidate achieved a majority
- Implementation and vote tabulation would be funded through existing Federal Election Commission budgets

**Section 2: Senate**
- Beginning with the 1998 elections, all Senate races would use Ranked Choice Voting
- Same ranking and counting procedures as House elections
- Staggered implementation following normal Senate election cycle

**Section 3: Presidential Elections**
- Beginning with the 2000 presidential election, each state would allocate electoral votes using Ranked Choice Voting among the state's popular vote
- A constitutional amendment to implement nationwide RCV for the Electoral College itself would be proposed separately
- States already using RCV for presidential elections (five states as of 1994) would continue their existing systems

**Section 4: Ballot Access**
- Any candidate who either: (a) qualified for ballot access in at least 40 states, OR (b) received at least 5% of votes in the previous election for that office, would be automatically included on the ballot nationwide
- This provision would end the requirement for third-party candidates to wage fifty separate ballot access battles
- Implementation beginning with the 1996 House elections

**Section 5: Public Education**
- The Federal Election Commission would conduct a public education campaign on RCV mechanics
- $50 million appropriated for voter education materials, sample ballots, and public service announcements
- Particular focus on communities without existing RCV experience

The bill's simplicity was its strength. It did one thing: changed how votes were counted. It didn't create new bureaucracies, impose unfunded mandates on states, or require complex implementation. Five states had already proven the system worked. The bill simply nationalized that success.

## The Coalition Emerges

The conventional wisdom said the bill had no chance. Why would Democrats and Republicans vote to end their duopoly? Why would they invite competition from third parties? The incentives all pointed toward preserving the status quo.

The conventional wisdom was wrong.

Senator Cohen's Republican co-sponsors included:
- Senator John McCain (Arizona) - "Let voters choose without fear"
- Senator Olympia Snowe (Maine) - "RCV works in Maine, it'll work nationally"
- Senator Nancy Kassebaum (Kansas) - "Farmers in my state belong to wind cooperatives with democratic governance. Why not Congress?"
- Senator Jim Jeffords (Vermont) - "I've seen RCV strengthen democracy, not weaken it"

The Democratic co-sponsors included:
- Senator Paul Wellstone (Minnesota) - "Coalition governance works at home, let's try it here"
- Senator Russ Feingold (Wisconsin) - "Campaign finance reform needs electoral reform"
- Senator Barbara Mikulski (Maryland) - "Ranked choice increases voter satisfaction"
- Senator Tom Harkin (Iowa) - "Farmers know cooperatives work better than monopolies"

The coalition was ideologically diverse—progressive Democrats and moderate Republicans, senators from RCV states and non-RCV states, representatives of urban and rural constituencies. What united them was either direct experience with ranked choice voting or openness to democratic experimentation.

But the real pressure came from outside Congress. United We Stand America mobilized its 4.2 million members to contact their representatives. The message was simple: "We voted for Perot. We're not going away. Pass the RCV Act or face primary challenges in 1996."

Editorial boards in the five RCV states ran coordinated editorials on March 15, 1994: "RCV Works Here, It Will Work Nationally." The *Portland Press Herald*, *Burlington Free Press*, *Minneapolis Star Tribune*, *Portland Oregonian*, and *Boston Globe* all made the same argument: three-way races were manageable under RCV, chaotic under plurality. The proof existed. Why not expand it?

Grassroots organizations that had built municipal broadband cooperatives, organized farmer-owned wind projects, and fought for RCV at state and local levels now turned their attention to federal legislation. They had experience with bottom-up organizing and democratic decision-making. They knew how to build coalitions.

The municipal broadband directors from 84 cities sent a joint letter to Congress: "We run telecommunications infrastructure democratically and it works better than corporate monopolies. Why can't you run elections democratically?"

The National Farmers Union, representing 300,000 farm families—many of them members of wind cooperatives—endorsed the bill: "We govern our cooperatives through democratic voting. Ranked choice is just democracy applied consistently."

By May 1994, polling showed 68% public support for the Federal RCV Act, including majorities of Democrats (72%), Republicans (61%), and Independents (74%). The demand was real, broad, and persistent.

## The Opposition

The opposition came from predictable quarters, though it was less unified than might be expected.

The Democratic National Committee opposed the bill, arguing that it would "fragment the coalition that has governed successfully for decades." Party leaders worried—correctly—that ranked choice voting would enable third parties and reduce Democratic and Republican dominance.

The Republican National Committee initially opposed the bill on similar grounds, but its position was complicated by support from Republican senators in RCV states and by polling that showed Republican voters supported electoral reform at nearly the same rates as Democrats.

Some civil rights organizations expressed concern that RCV was too complicated and might suppress turnout among communities with language barriers or lower education levels. Academic researchers from the five RCV states responded with data: turnout in RCV elections was consistently 8-12 percentage points higher than in similar plurality elections, and the gap was largest in communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods. The system was learnable, and voters preferred it once they experienced it.

Corporate interests that benefited from the two-party duopoly—particularly those that could donate to both parties and ensure favorable treatment regardless of who won—quietly lobbied against the bill. But that lobbying was less effective than in the path not taken, because the campaign finance system here was different. Public financing of campaigns, enacted in the 1970s and expanded in the 1980s, meant that corporate donations were less decisive. Members of Congress were freer to vote their conscience—or their constituents' preferences.

The most sophisticated opposition came from political scientists who argued that RCV would lead to political fragmentation and unstable coalition governments. They pointed to multi-party systems in Europe that sometimes required months to form governing coalitions.

Proponents responded with data from the five RCV states and 28 RCV cities. Coalition governance was more stable, not less, because it required ongoing negotiation and compromise rather than winner-take-all dominance followed by complete reversal when power changed hands. Policies enacted by coalitions were more durable because they had broader support. The concern about instability was theoretical; the evidence showed the opposite.

By August 1994, the opposition had failed to make a persuasive case. The bill had momentum.

## The Compromise

The final version of the Federal RCV Act that came to a vote in October 1994 included one significant compromise: implementation for House elections would begin in 1996, but participation would be optional for states in the first cycle. States could choose to continue using plurality voting for the 1996 House elections if they passed legislation opting out before January 1, 1996.

This compromise brought on board senators and representatives from states with strong two-party establishment control. They could vote for the bill and tell their party leadership, "Don't worry, our state will opt out for 1996 and we'll see how it goes elsewhere."

The compromise also included enhanced funding for public education—$84 million over two years instead of $50 million—and a provision requiring the General Accounting Office to study implementation and report to Congress after the 1996 elections.

Progressive reformers weren't happy with the opt-out provision, but they accepted it as the price of passage. Wellstone put it plainly: "I'd prefer mandatory nationwide implementation. But I'll take 40 states using RCV in 1996 over zero states because we insisted on perfection."

## The Vote

The Federal Ranked Choice Voting Act came to a vote in the Senate on October 18, 1994. The chamber was packed. C-SPAN viewership reached record levels. United We Stand America had organized watch parties in all 50 states.

The final tally: 64-36 in favor.

The breakdown revealed the coalition that had emerged:
- 38 Democrats voted yes, 18 voted no
- 24 Republicans voted yes, 18 voted no  
- 2 Independents voted yes (Bernie Sanders of Vermont, recently elected, and Jim Jeffords who had switched from Republican)

Support came from:
- All 5 senators from RCV states (Maine, Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon, Massachusetts)
- Moderate Republicans who saw the bill as good governance reform
- Progressive Democrats who wanted multi-party democracy
- Senators from agricultural states with strong cooperative movements
- Senators from states with municipal broadband cooperatives

Opposition came from:
- Party leadership protecting institutional power
- Senators from states with strong single-party dominance (both red and blue states)
- Senators who genuinely believed two-party competition was optimal
- Senators worried about primary challenges from party establishments

The House vote, held October 27, 1994, was closer: 224-211. But it passed.

President Clinton signed the Federal Ranked Choice Voting Act into law on November 4, 1994—two years and one day after the election that had demonstrated the need for it.

## What Changed Immediately

The immediate effects were procedural but profound:

**Ballot Access:** Beginning with the 1996 House elections, any candidate who received 5% of the vote in 1994 or qualified for ballot access in 40 states would be automatically included on the ballot nationwide. This ended the kafkaesque process of third-party candidates fighting fifty separate ballot access battles, each with different signature requirements and deadlines. The Reform Party (Perot's formal political party, founded in 1995), the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and others would have automatic ballot access for any race where they met the threshold.

**Primary Incentives:** Under plurality voting, primary elections rewarded candidates who excited the party base, even if they were unelectable in the general election. Under RCV, general election strategy changed. Candidates still needed to win their party's nomination, but they also needed to be acceptable as a second choice to voters from other parties. This created an incentive toward moderation and coalition-building that didn't exist under plurality voting.

**Media Coverage:** The political media had long operated on the assumption of a two-way race. "Which of the two candidates will you vote for?" "The race is tied 47-47, where will the 6% of undecided voters go?" RCV required different questions: "How would you rank the candidates?" "Who are voters' second choices?" Media organizations in the five RCV states had developed this coverage capacity; now it would spread nationally.

**Strategic Calculations:** Under plurality voting, third parties faced a catch-22: voters wouldn't support them because they couldn't win, and they couldn't win because voters wouldn't support them. RCV broke that cycle. A voter could rank the Green Party first and the Democrat second, or the Libertarian first and the Republican second, without "wasting" their vote. This changed everything about third-party viability.

## The Backlash That Wasn't

Political scientists and journalists expected backlash. Changing electoral systems was supposed to be impossible—too many entrenched interests, too much path dependence, too much inertia.

The backlash never materialized. By November 1994, polling showed:
- 71% of Americans supported the RCV Act
- 68% said they were "excited" or "hopeful" about being able to rank candidates
- 58% said they were more likely to vote in 1996 because of RCV
- 84% of residents in RCV states said they wanted to keep the system (up from 68% before implementation)

The support cut across party lines, age groups, education levels, and geographic regions. Once people experienced ranking their preferences and seeing the results reflect majority will rather than plurality distortion, they didn't want to go back.

Three months after passage, only two states had enacted legislation opting out of RCV for the 1996 House elections: Alabama and Wyoming, both single-party dominated states where the state legislature was controlled by a supermajority of one party.

Forty-eight states would use Ranked Choice Voting for House elections in 1996. The transformation had begun.

## The Deeper Shift

Underneath the procedural changes, something more fundamental was happening. The political system was being democratized to match the economic system.

Workers who governed their cooperatives democratically were now going to elect their representatives democratically. Farmers who made decisions about wind turbine placement through ranked voting were now going to elect Congress the same way. Residents who voted on municipal broadband policies through referendum were now going to rank their preferences for federal office.

The disconnect was being resolved. Democratic governance was becoming universal rather than selective.

Maria Rodriguez, a 42-year-old solar cooperative worker-owner in New Mexico, explained it in an interview with the *Albuquerque Journal*: "At work, we vote on major decisions. Everyone gets a say. Nobody can tell us, 'Pick between these two options we pre-selected for you.' Why should electing Congress be different? Ranked choice just applies the same democratic principles to politics that we already use in our economic lives."

That sentiment was widespread. The 1.2 million Americans who worked at cooperatives, the 8,400 farmers who belonged to wind co-ops, the 6.8 million residents served by municipal broadband, the 52% of workers who belonged to unions with democratic governance—they had experienced democratic decision-making that went beyond binary choices. They wanted their political system to match.

The Federal RCV Act of 1994 gave them that. But it was just the beginning. The 1996 House elections would show what happened when voters could actually express their preferences instead of being forced into false binaries.

The duopoly's stranglehold had been broken. Now came the question: what would emerge in its place?
