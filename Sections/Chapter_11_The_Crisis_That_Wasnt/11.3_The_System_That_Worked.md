# 11.3 The System That Worked

*2013-2016 and Reflection*

By 2013, the alternative system had been operating for nearly seventy years. The grandchildren of those who had voted for the Public Money Act of 1945 were now themselves grandparents. Three generations had lived under an architecture of public credit, cooperative ownership, and multi-party democracy. The question was no longer "Will this work?" but "How well does it work, and what comes next?"

The answer would define the mid-2010s and set the stage for the mature system of 2025.

## Obama's Second Term: Consolidation

President Obama's second term (2013-2016) focused on consolidating gains and addressing remaining challenges:

**Climate Action Accelerates (2013-2016):**

The Green New Deal targets were being met ahead of schedule:
- 2013: Renewable electricity 78%
- 2014: Renewable electricity 80% (target met, 6 years early)
- 2015: Renewable electricity 84%
- 2016: Renewable electricity 88%

By 2016, coal-fired power had declined to 6% of generation (from 52% in 1990). Natural gas held 6%, providing backup for renewable variability. Emissions had fallen to -54% vs. 1990 levels—among the lowest per capita in the developed world.

**Transportation Transformation:**
- High-speed rail: 4,200 miles operational by 2016 (California, Northeast, Texas, Midwest)
- Electric vehicles: 14 million on road (vs. 540,000 in path not taken)
- Public transit ridership: Up 68% since 2008 due to investment
- Urban cycling: 18% of commutes in major cities (vs. 2% in path not taken)
- Aviation: Research into sustainable aviation fuel and electric short-haul planes

**Building Sector:**
- Residential retrofits: 28 million homes (2009-2016), reducing energy use 32%
- New construction standards: Net-zero energy by 2020 (California 2014, national 2018)
- Commercial buildings: 1.2 million retrofitted
- District heating/cooling: 84 district energy systems in dense urban areas

**Results by 2016:**
- Total emissions: -54% vs. 1990
- Per capita emissions: 8.2 tons CO2e (vs. 18.4 tons in path not taken)
- Renewable energy employment: 3.8 million jobs
- Energy independence: 96% domestic energy production
- Energy costs: Stable and declining (renewable LCOE below fossil fuels)

**The Paris Agreement (2015):**

In the path not taken, the 2015 Paris Agreement would set aspirational targets that most countries would fail to meet. Here, the agreement was both more ambitious and more achievable:

**U.S. Paris Commitment:**
- 70% emissions reduction by 2025 (vs. 1990)
- 95% emissions reduction by 2035
- Carbon neutrality by 2040
- $168 billion in climate finance for developing nations (2016-2025)

The commitments were credible because the track record was real. The U.S. had already achieved -54% by 2016 and was on pace for -70% by 2025.

**Global Context:**
Nations with public credit systems (108 countries by 2015) made similarly ambitious commitments. Debt-free development through public credit meant they could invest in renewable energy without the debt crises that would constrain the path not taken.

**Paris Results (by 2016):**
- 178 countries signed (vs. 195 in path not taken, but with stronger commitments)
- Aggregate pledges: Limit warming to 1.8°C (vs. 2.4°C trajectory in path not taken)
- Climate finance: $240B annually pledged (vs. $100B in path not taken, mostly unfulfilled)

## Cooperative Ownership Reaches Critical Mass

By 2016, cooperative worker ownership had reached 36.2% of the workforce—more than one-third. This was a tipping point:

**Cooperative Workforce (2016):**
- Manufacturing: 540,000 workers
- Technology: 68,000 workers
- Healthcare: 184,000 workers
- Retail: 124,000 workers
- Agriculture: 480,000 workers (in co-ops, plus 124,000 farm families in wind/solar co-ops)
- Services: 420,000 workers
- Finance: 96,000 workers (credit unions, cooperative banks)
- Media: 12,000 workers
- Education: 84,000 workers (cooperative schools, training centers)
- Platform economy: 520,000 workers (ride-sharing, delivery, freelancing—all cooperative)
- Total: 2.5 million worker-owners out of 6.9 million total cooperative workforce

**Economic Impact:**

Cooperative enterprises demonstrated consistent advantages:
- Productivity: Equal to traditional firms (output per worker hour)
- Wages: 24% higher than traditional firms in same sectors
- Wealth building: Worker-owners accumulated median equity stake of $168,000
- Job stability: Layoff rate 68% lower (cooperatives cut hours or pay temporarily rather than firing)
- Innovation: Patent applications per worker equal to traditional firms
- Longevity: 10-year survival rate 82% (vs. 42% for traditional startups)

**Political Impact:**

With 36% of workers owning their companies, political culture shifted:
- Support for cooperative conversion: 84% of voters
- OPC credit favorability: 88%
- Understanding of democratic ownership: 92% could explain how cooperatives work
- Desire for workplace democracy: 68% of traditional employees wanted their company to convert

The cooperative economy had moved from alternative to mainstream. It was no longer "the cooperative sector"—it was simply how one-third of the economy operated.

## Universal Healthcare Matures

By 2016, the two-tier healthcare system (public option + private insurance) had stabilized:

**Coverage (2016):**
- Public option: 168 million people (52%)
- Private insurance: 152 million people (47%)
- Uninsured: 3.2 million (1%, mostly by choice—wealthy individuals opting out)

**Costs (2016):**
- Healthcare as % of GDP: 11.2% (vs. 17.8% in path not taken)
- Per capita spending: $7,200 (vs. $12,400 in path not taken)
- Public option premiums: Average 5.2% of income
- Private insurance premiums: Average 8.4% of income (had to compete with public option)

**Outcomes (2016):**
- Life expectancy: 80.2 years (vs. 78.4 in path not taken)
- Infant mortality: 4.2 per 1,000 (vs. 5.8 in path not taken)
- Preventable deaths: -42% vs. path not taken
- Medical bankruptcy: 0.1 per 100,000 (essentially eliminated)
- Patient satisfaction: Public option 86%, private insurance 74%

**Innovation:**

The concern that public healthcare would stifle innovation proved false:
- Medical device patents: Growing 4.2% annually
- Pharmaceutical research: $84 billion annually (vs. $64 billion in path not taken)
- Public option invested 6% of budget in research (vs. private insurers investing 0%)
- Breakthrough drugs: Rate unchanged (profit motive not necessary for innovation)

The public option's lower overhead (4% vs. 18% private) and negotiating power created space for both lower costs and research investment.

## Education Excellence

By 2016, the education system was producing strong outcomes:

**K-12 (2016):**
- International test scores: Top 10 globally in math, science, reading (vs. top 25-30 in path not taken)
- Graduation rate: 92% (vs. 84% in path not taken)
- Achievement gaps (by race/income): Narrowing consistently
- Teacher median salary: $94,000 (vs. $58,000 in path not taken)
- Student-teacher ratio: 13:1 (vs. 17:1)

**Higher Education (2016):**
- College enrollment: 22.4 million students
- Graduation rate: 76% (vs. 60% in path not taken)
- Student debt (total): $42 billion (vs. $1.4 trillion in path not taken)
- Average debt per graduate: $2,400 (vs. $39,000 in path not taken)
- Debt-free graduates: 68% (vs. 28% in path not taken)

**Technical Education (2016):**
- Enrollment: 12.8 million students
- Fields: Renewable energy tech, programming, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, cooperative management
- Completion rate: 82%
- Employment rate: 96% within 6 months
- Median starting wage: $64,000
- Debt load: $800 average (essentially free)

**Cooperative Apprenticeships:**
- Annual graduates: 184,000
- Starting equity stake: $24,000-$42,000
- This pipeline was producing new generation of worker-owners directly from education

## The 2016 Elections

The 2016 presidential and congressional elections would define the direction for the next four years:

**Presidential Election (2016):**

Seven major candidates competed:

**First Round:**
- Hillary Clinton (D): 38.4%
- Donald Trump (Conservative): 22.8%
- Bernie Sanders (Green): 18.2%
- John Kasich (R): 12.4%
- Gary Johnson (Libertarian): 6.2%
- Tom Cotton (Reform): 1.4%
- Others: 0.6%

**Second Round (Others eliminated):**
- Clinton: 39.2%
- Trump: 23.4%
- Sanders: 18.6%
- Kasich: 12.8%
- Johnson: 6.0%

**Third Round (Johnson eliminated):**
- Clinton: 41.8%
- Trump: 24.2%
- Sanders: 19.4%
- Kasich: 14.6%

**Fourth Round (Kasich eliminated):**
- Clinton: 48.2%
- Sanders: 27.4%
- Trump: 24.4%

**Fifth Round (Trump eliminated):**
- Hillary Clinton (D): 62.8%
- Bernie Sanders (Green): 37.2%

Clinton won decisively with 354 electoral votes to Sanders' 184. But the race revealed interesting dynamics:

Trump's populist economic nationalism attracted 22.8% first-round support—real grievances about trade and cultural change existed here too. But without the economic desperation of the path not taken (where median household wealth was $97K vs. $364K here), his message gained less traction. Moreover, when Trump was eliminated in round 4, his voters split—48% to Clinton, 42% to Sanders, 10% exhausted. The "burn it down" anger that would elect him in the path not taken was muted here by actual prosperity.

Sanders' 18.2% first-round showing as the Green candidate (having left Democrats in 2012 to lead the Green Party) demonstrated that the progressive wing wanted more than Clinton's moderate incrementalism. The coalition would need to accommodate that demand.

**Congressional Results (2017-2018):**

**House:**
- Democrats: 204
- Republicans: 162
- Greens: 36
- Reform: 22
- Labor: 10
- Libertarians: 1

**Senate:**
- Democrats: 48
- Republicans: 32
- Greens: 14
- Reform: 4
- Labor: 2

The coalition shifted further left. Democrats-Greens-Labor had 250 House seats (57.5%) and 64 Senate seats (64%). Clinton would need to work with a progressive coalition, particularly the surging Greens who had gained 4 House seats and 2 Senate seats.

## The Clinton Administration Begins

Hillary Clinton took office in January 2017 as the first woman president, governing with a progressive coalition:

**Cabinet Appointments:**
- Secretary of State: Wendy Sherman (D)
- Secretary of Treasury: Sherrod Brown (D)
- Secretary of Defense: Michele Flournoy (D)
- Attorney General: Sally Yates (D)
- Secretary of Interior: Raul Grijalva (Green)
- Secretary of Energy: Jennifer Granholm (Labor)
- EPA Administrator: Gina McCarthy (D)
- Special Advisor on Cooperative Economics: Maria Rodriguez (worker-owner from Chapter 8, now age 64)

The inclusion of Green and Labor members in key positions signaled genuine coalition governance.

**Early Actions (2017):**

**January 2017:** Infrastructure Investment Act II passed 258-177 (House) and 62-38 (Senate). Allocated $520 billion over 10 years for:
- High-speed rail expansion: $168B (complete national network by 2030)
- Urban public transit: $124B
- Rural broadband: $84B (universal 1 Gbps by 2025)
- Water systems: $68B (replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment)
- Grid modernization: $42B (handle 100% renewable by 2030)
- Green buildings: $34B (retrofit federal buildings to net-zero)

**March 2017:** Proportional Representation Amendment passed Congress 68-32 (Senate) and 284-151 (House), sent to states for ratification. Proposed changing House elections from single-member districts to proportional representation by state—parties would receive seats matching their vote share. Would strengthen multi-party democracy further.

**June 2017:** Labor Rights Expansion Act passed 252-183 (House) and 58-42 (Senate):
- Card check union recognition (majority sign cards = automatic recognition)
- Strengthened collective bargaining rights
- Mandatory worker board representation: 40% of board seats at companies >500 employees
- Cooperative conversion right: Workers could propose cooperative conversion, company forced to negotiate

The legislation aimed to expand worker power further and accelerate cooperative conversion.

## The Mature System: What Had Been Achieved

By mid-2017, seventy-two years after the Public Money Act of 1945, the alternative system could be evaluated comprehensively:

**Economic Architecture:**
- Public credit at cost: OPC issued $2.8 trillion in outstanding credit (0% education, 0.3% housing, 1.0-2.0% business, 1.5% cooperatives)
- 100% reserve banking: Banks as utilities, no credit creation
- Cooperative ownership: 36.2% of workforce
- Worker board representation: 68% of companies >500 employees
- Union membership: 56%
- Median household income: $158,000
- Median household wealth: $364,000
- Income inequality (Gini): 0.328 (declining)
- Poverty rate: 4.2%
- CEO-to-worker pay: 38:1

**Environmental Achievement:**
- Renewable electricity: 88% (2016)
- Emissions: -54% vs. 1990
- Per capita emissions: 8.2 tons CO2e (vs. 18.4 in path not taken)
- Energy independence: 96%
- Electric vehicles: 14 million
- High-speed rail: 4,200 miles operational
- Coal: 6% of electricity (dying sector)
- Sustainable agriculture: 42% of farmland organic or regenerative

**Social Infrastructure:**
- Universal healthcare: 99% coverage, 11.2% of GDP
- Education: Near-zero debt, strong outcomes, technical education valued equally
- Housing: Homeownership 73%, 0.3% OPC mortgages, median price-to-income 2.2
- Retirement security: Pensions + Social Security + cooperative equity stakes
- Life expectancy: 80.2 years
- Work week: 33.8 hours average
- Vacation: 22 days median

**Democratic Achievement:**
- Multi-party system: 6-7 parties in Congress
- Coalition governance: Normalized, functional
- Voter turnout: 74% (2016)
- Congressional approval: 68%
- Campaign finance: Corporate spending limited, public financing robust
- Media pluralism: Diverse, cooperative news organizations, no consolidation
- RCV satisfaction: 84%

**Global Influence:**
- Public credit systems: 108 countries (2016)
- Multi-party RCV: 46 countries
- Cooperative economics: 540 million workers globally
- Paris Agreement: Stronger commitments, achievable targets
- Debt-free development: Alternative to IMF/World Bank structural adjustment

## The Comparison

By 2016, seven decades of different architectural choices had produced comprehensive divergence:

**Economic:**
- This timeline: Median income $158K, wealth $364K, Gini 0.328, poverty 4.2%, cooperative workforce 36%
- Path not taken: Median income $82K, wealth $97K, Gini 0.492, poverty 13.5%, cooperative workforce <1%
- Divergence: Income +93%, wealth +275%, inequality -33%, poverty -69%

**Environmental:**
- This timeline: Emissions -54%, renewable 88%, per capita 8.2 tons CO2e, climate action ahead of schedule
- Path not taken: Emissions +16%, renewable 15%, per capita 18.4 tons CO2e, climate crisis accelerating
- Divergence: 70 percentage point emissions difference, climate crisis being addressed vs. worsening

**Political:**
- This timeline: Multi-party democracy, coalition governance, 74% turnout, 68% approval, functional compromise
- Path not taken: Two-party polarization, partisan warfare, 56% turnout, 14% approval, complete gridlock
- Divergence: Democracy functional vs. dysfunctional, citizens engaged vs. cynical

**Social:**
- This timeline: Universal healthcare, near-zero student debt, strong unions, secure retirements, 33.8 hour work week
- Path not taken: Partial healthcare, $1.4T student debt, weak unions, retirement insecurity, 40+ hour work week
- Divergence: Security vs. precarity, time for living vs. constant work

**Global:**
- This timeline: 108 countries with public credit, 46 with RCV, cooperative economics global, climate cooperation strong
- Path not taken: Debt-based development dominant, two-party systems common, climate action blocked, increasing instability
- Divergence: Cooperation model spreading vs. competition model dominant

The architectural choices made in the 1940s—public credit, cooperative ownership, democratic governance—had compounded over seven decades into radically different outcomes across every measurable dimension.

## The Voices

Three voices capture what had been achieved:

**Maria Rodriguez, 64, Solar Cooperative Worker-Owner (introduced in Chapter 8):**

"I started working at the solar cooperative in 1989 when I was 36 years old. I'd been laid off from a garment factory and needed work. The cooperative trained me, gave me a job, and made me an owner.

"Twenty-seven years later, I'm retiring with equity stake worth $284,000, Social Security, and pension from the cooperative. I own my home—paid off the 0.3% OPC mortgage in 2014. My kids graduated college debt-free. They both work at cooperatives now—my daughter in healthcare, my son in software.

"I've read about the path not taken. In that timeline, I'd be working retail at 64, no retirement savings, still paying rent, my kids crushed by student debt. Instead, I'm retiring comfortably, traveling to see my grandchildren, volunteering at the community center.

"That's what architecture means. The system gave me the opportunity to build a life. Not through luck or exceptional talent—I'm a regular person who installs solar panels. Through structure. Through public credit that financed my training. Through cooperative ownership that gave me equity. Through wages that tracked productivity instead of being suppressed.

"The question isn't 'why does this timeline work so well?' It's 'why did anyone think the other way would work at all?'"

**Dr. Sarah Chen, 42, Political Scientist at Berkeley (introduced in Chapter 10):**

"I teach a class called 'Comparative Political Systems: Multi-Party vs. Two-Party Democracy.' Every semester, students read about the two-party duopoly that dominated American politics for 140 years, ending in 1996. They can't comprehend it.

"'You could only choose between two options?' they ask. 'Even when you didn't like either one?' 'And third parties were called spoilers for giving voters more choices?' 'That sounds authoritarian, not democratic.'

"They're right. Multi-party democracy isn't exotic—it's normal. Letting voters rank preferences isn't complicated—it's obvious. Coalition governance isn't unstable—it's more stable than winner-take-all dominance that gets reversed every election.

"We've proven this for twenty years. Six to seven parties in Congress, coalition governance, 68% approval, 74% turnout, functional compromise. Not perfect—we still have disagreements, still have challenges—but incomparably better than two-party warfare.

"My students ask, 'Will we ever go back to two parties?' I tell them: 'Would you go back to having only two choices? Would you want to be forced into binary options on complex issues? Would you prefer winner-take-all dominance to negotiated coalition?'

"They look at me like I'm crazy for even asking. And that's when I know the transformation is permanent. They don't remember the old system. They only know democracy that works."

**James Thompson III, 28, Cooperative Software Developer (grandson of James Thompson from Chapter 6):**

"My grandfather was born in 1887. He lived through both systems—the one where finance controlled everything, and the one we live in now where people do. He died in 1982 at age 95, having seen the transformation.

"He used to tell me: 'The system you grow up in seems natural until you see the alternative. Then you realize what was natural was just what you were used to. What works better is what's actually natural.'

"I work at a software cooperative. 420 worker-owners, 4:1 pay ratio, democratic governance. We develop open-source tools for cooperative management—accounting, scheduling, governance, communication. Our software runs 4,200 cooperatives globally.

"I make $84,000 a year plus equity stake. My pay ratio means the lowest-paid worker makes $68,000 and the highest makes $112,000. Compare that to the path not taken where a CEO might make $12 million while programmers make $65,000. The productivity is the same. The products are the same. The only difference is who gets the value we create.

"I graduated college two years ago with zero debt. I bought a home last year with 0.3% OPC mortgage. I work 32 hours a week—that's standard at our cooperative. I have time to volunteer coaching youth soccer, time to pursue hobbies, time to live.

"My grandfather saw both worlds. He knew what we avoided. My generation only knows what works. But we study the path not taken to remember: this didn't happen by accident. It happened by design. And we have to keep defending that design, keep improving it, keep proving that cooperation works better than extraction.

"Because the alternative? That's not even alternative. That's just disaster."

## Looking Forward

As 2017 began and President Clinton prepared to govern with a progressive coalition, the question facing the nation wasn't whether the system worked—seventy-two years of evidence proved it did. The question was what to do with a system that worked.

The next challenges were clear:

**Climate:** Achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030, carbon neutrality by 2040, and lead global climate action

**Cooperation:** Grow cooperative ownership from 36% to 50%+ of workforce, making democratic ownership the norm rather than the exception

**Democracy:** Pass Proportional Representation Amendment (working through state ratification), potentially creating 10-15 party Congress with even more diverse representation

**Global:** Spread public credit and cooperative models to remaining nations, create truly cooperative global economy

**Technology:** Ensure emerging technologies (AI, biotech, nanotech) developed under cooperative governance and public benefit rather than monopoly extraction

**Equity:** Continue narrowing racial and gender wealth gaps, achieve full economic and social equality

**Time:** Reduce work week to 30 hours or less, giving people more time for living, learning, community, democracy

The system that worked could work even better. The architecture was sound. The outcomes were strong. The potential was vast.

The next decade would test how far democratic cooperation could be taken—and what a truly mature alternative system looked like.
