# 11.2 The Decade of Deepening

*2009-2012*

While the path not taken struggled through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression—unemployment lines, foreclosed homes, bank bailouts, austerity debates—this timeline experienced what would be called "The Decade of Deepening." Not a decade of recovery from crisis, but a decade of deepening the alternative economic model that had prevented crisis in the first place.

The 2008 slowdown had been managed successfully. By mid-2009, growth had returned to normal levels. Unemployment peaked at 5.2% and declined back to 4.4% by 2010. The question facing the coalition government wasn't "how do we recover?" but "what do we build next?"

The answer would define the early 21st century.

## The 2008 Elections and Coalition Evolution

The November 2008 elections—House, Senate, and President—took place during the economic slowdown but before the crisis hit the path not taken. The political environment was mildly anxious but not panicked:

**Presidential Election (2008):**

Six major candidates competed, with RCV delivering a clear result:

**First Round:**
- Barack Obama (D): 44.8% - Senator from Illinois, coalition-builder, message of change
- John McCain (R): 28.2% - Senator from Arizona, veteran, moderate conservative
- Elizabeth Warren (Green): 14.2% - Harvard professor, consumer advocate, financial reform champion
- Ron Paul (Libertarian): 7.4% - Texas congressman, anti-war, limited government
- Tom Vilsack (Reform): 4.2% - Iowa governor, rural populist
- Chuck Baldwin (Conservative): 1.2%

**Final Round (after redistribution):**
- Barack Obama (D): 56.8%
- John McCain (R): 43.2%

Obama won decisively, carrying 324 electoral votes to McCain's 214. But the first-round numbers told the deeper story: 55.2% of voters ranked someone other than Obama or McCain first. Multi-party democracy was mature.

**Congressional Results (2009-2010):**

**House:**
- Democrats: 208
- Republicans: 164
- Greens: 28
- Reform: 26
- Labor: 8
- Libertarians: 1

**Senate:**
- Democrats: 48
- Republicans: 32
- Greens: 10
- Reform: 8
- Labor: 2

The coalition shifted significantly left. Democrats-Greens-Labor had 286 House seats (65.7%) and 60 Senate seats (60%)—a supermajority in the House and filibuster-proof majority in the Senate under the reformed 55-vote cloture rule.

This Green surge reflected voter priorities: climate action, economic justice, healthcare expansion. Warren's 14.2% first-round showing and the Greens' gains in Congress gave them leverage in the coalition. Progressive policy would accelerate.

## The Green New Deal (2009)

With a progressive supermajority and President Obama committed to climate action, the coalition moved aggressively:

The **Green New Deal Act of 2009**, passed in August with 294-141 (House) and 64-36 (Senate), set the most ambitious climate goals in any nation's history:

**Targets:**
- 80% renewable electricity by 2020 (from 48% in 2008)
- 100% renewable electricity by 2030
- Carbon neutrality economy-wide by 2040
- Emissions reduction: -60% by 2020, -95% by 2040 (vs. 1990 baseline)

**Implementation:**
- $420 billion over 10 years for renewable energy deployment
- $168 billion for grid modernization and energy storage
- $84 billion for building efficiency retrofits (public and private)
- $126 billion for public transportation and high-speed rail
- $62 billion for research and development (next-gen solar, fusion, storage)
- $84 billion for just transition—retraining and support for fossil fuel workers

**Financing:**
- OPC credit at 1.5% for renewable energy projects
- Carbon tax starting at $28/ton (2010), rising $8/ton annually to $84/ton (2017)
- Progressive taxation on highest incomes (52% top marginal rate on income >$2M)
- Reduction in military spending (peace dividend from no War on Terror: $84B annually)

**Structure:**
- Cooperative ownership prioritized—renewable projects received 1.0% OPC credit if worker-owned vs. 1.5% for traditional firms
- Municipal and community ownership encouraged—$42B in grants for local renewable projects
- Worker board representation required for any project receiving federal support
- Just Transition Authority established—guaranteed jobs or retraining for displaced fossil fuel workers

The legislation passed with full coalition support (Democrats, Greens, Labor) plus 6 moderate Republicans from renewable energy states.

## The Renewable Revolution Accelerates

The 2009 Green New Deal turbocharged trends already underway:

**Solar Deployment (2009-2012):**
- 2008: 28,000 MW capacity
- 2012: 124,000 MW capacity (4.4x growth in 4 years)
- Jobs created: 284,000 in installation, manufacturing, maintenance
- 89% domestic manufacturing (vs. 100% imported in path not taken)
- Cooperative ownership: 58% of new solar projects

**Wind Deployment (2009-2012):**
- 2008: 84,000 MW capacity
- 2012: 224,000 MW capacity (2.7x growth)
- Jobs created: 186,000
- Farmer-owned cooperatives: 342 co-ops, 84,000 farm members
- Median supplemental income for co-op members: $48,000/year

**Grid Modernization:**
- Smart grid deployment: 68% of households by 2012
- Energy storage: 24,000 MW battery storage (vs. near-zero in path not taken)
- Transmission expansion: 28,000 miles of new high-voltage lines
- Microgrid development: 420 community microgrids providing resilience

**Building Efficiency:**
- Residential retrofits: 12 million homes (2009-2012)
- Commercial retrofits: 420,000 buildings
- Energy savings: -28% per household
- Jobs created: 340,000 in efficiency retrofit sector

**Transportation Transformation:**
- High-speed rail: 2,400 miles under construction (California, Northeast Corridor, Texas Triangle, Midwest network)
- Electric vehicle adoption: 4.2 million EVs on road by 2012 (vs. 120,000 in path not taken)
- Public transit expansion: $84B investment in buses, light rail, commuter rail
- Bicycle infrastructure: 12,000 miles of protected bike lanes in cities

**Results by 2012:**
- Renewable electricity: 76% of generation (on track for 80% by 2020)
- Emissions: -42% vs. 1990 levels (vs. +8% in path not taken—50 percentage point difference)
- Coal plant closures: 240 plants (vs. 60 in path not taken)
- Natural gas: Declining (vs. "bridge fuel" narrative in path not taken)
- Clean energy employment: 2.8 million jobs (vs. 380,000 in path not taken)

## The Cooperative Economy Matures

The economic slowdown of 2008 had encouraged worker buyouts of struggling traditional firms. The Cooperative Stabilization Act's favorable credit terms (1.5% vs. normal 2.5%) accelerated conversion:

**2008-2012 Cooperative Growth:**
- Traditional firms converted to cooperatives: 420 companies (184,000 workers)
- New cooperative startups: 1,240 firms (96,000 workers)
- Platform cooperatives: 84 digital worker-owned platforms (324,000 workers)
- Cooperative workforce: 26.8% (2008) → 32.4% (2012)

The 32.4% threshold was significant—roughly one-third of workers now owned their companies. This created a political constituency with direct experience of democratic ownership and shared prosperity.

**Cooperative Sectors (2012):**

**Manufacturing:** 420,000 workers in cooperative manufacturing, producing everything from solar panels to electric vehicles to furniture. Median worker-owner income: $72,000 plus equity stake averaging $124,000.

**Technology:** 280 software cooperatives employing 48,000 workers. OpenCompute Cooperative had grown to 840 worker-owners, maintaining 4:1 pay ratio. Cooperative software market share: 42% (vs. Microsoft/Apple duopoly in path not taken).

**Healthcare:** 184 healthcare cooperatives—clinics, hospitals, home health agencies—employing 124,000 workers. Cooperative healthcare demonstrated lower costs (22% below traditional private) and higher quality (patient satisfaction 84% vs. 62%).

**Retail:** 340 retail cooperatives including groceries, hardware stores, bookstores, employing 96,000 workers. Competed successfully against traditional chains by emphasizing local sourcing, worker knowledge, and community investment.

**Agriculture:** 2,840 agricultural cooperatives representing 420,000 farm families. Wind cooperatives alone provided $48,000/year median supplemental income, stabilizing rural economies that would have collapsed in the path not taken.

**Finance:** 124 credit unions and cooperative banks with $420 billion in assets. Operated under 100% reserve requirements, provided consumer banking services, brokered OPC credit for fees.

**Media:** 68 cooperative news organizations—newspapers, radio stations, digital outlets—employing 8,400 journalists. Demonstrated that journalism could be funded through member subscriptions and cooperative ownership rather than advertising or billionaire owners.

## Healthcare Expansion

Building on the 2004 Public Option Act, the coalition moved toward universal coverage:

**The Universal Healthcare Act of 2010**, passed 276-159 (House) and 58-42 (Senate):

**Structure:**
- Public option expanded to cover all citizens
- Private insurance remained available but competed with public option
- Public option premiums capped at 6% of income (down from 8%)
- Prescription drug prices negotiated federally—average reduction 48%
- Preventive care fully covered (no copays or deductibles)
- Mental health parity strengthened

**Financing:**
- Progressive taxation (paid by income >$400K)
- Efficiency savings from public option administration (overhead 4% vs. 18% private)
- Prescription drug negotiation savings ($84B annually)
- Reduced need for emergency care (prevention emphasis)

**Results by 2012:**
- Uninsured rate: 1.8% (vs. 15.4% in path not taken)
- Healthcare costs as % GDP: 12.2% (vs. 17.4% in path not taken)
- Life expectancy: 79.4 years (vs. 77.8 in path not taken)
- Medical bankruptcy: Virtually eliminated (0.2 per 100,000)
- Public option enrollment: 142 million (48% of population)
- Private insurance: 152 million (52% of population, competing on quality)

The two-tier system—public option and private insurance—delivered universal coverage while maintaining choice. The public option's lower costs and comprehensive coverage made it attractive to roughly half the population. Private insurers responded by improving service rather than denying claims.

## Education Transformation

The Education Investment Act of 2002 had expanded OPC 0% credit to technical training. The 2009-2012 period saw this model mature:

**Higher Education (2012):**
- Public university enrollment: 18.2 million students
- Student debt (total national): $28 billion (vs. $1.2 trillion in path not taken)
- Average debt per graduate: $1,540 (vs. $35,000 in path not taken)
- Graduation rate: 72% (vs. 58% in path not taken)
- Employment within 6 months: 86% (vs. 68% in path not taken)

**Technical Education (2012):**
- Technical program enrollment: 8.4 million students (growth of 420% since 2002)
- Programs: Electrician, plumbing, programming, nursing, renewable energy tech, cooperative management, advanced manufacturing
- Completion rate: 78% (higher than traditional college)
- Employment within 3 months: 94%
- Median starting wage: $58,000
- OPC 0% credit coverage: Tuition, materials, living expenses during training

**Cooperative Apprenticeships (2012):**
- Students completing apprenticeships at worker cooperatives: 124,000 annually
- Upon completion: Offered worker-owner positions with equity stake
- Starting equity value: $18,000-$32,000
- This model combined education with ownership preparation—graduates entered workforce as owners, not just workers

**K-12 Education (2012):**
- Federal education spending: $124 billion annually (vs. $68 billion in path not taken)
- Teacher median salary: $82,000 (vs. $54,000 in path not taken)
- Student-teacher ratio: 14:1 (vs. 16:1)
- School infrastructure: $42B investment in building upgrades, technology
- Results: International test scores rising, achievement gaps narrowing

## The Political Culture Deepens

By 2010, multi-party coalition governance had been operating for 14 years at the federal level. The culture changes were profound:

**Campaign Finance:** The 2001 Campaign Finance Reform Act had limited corporate PAC contributions to $5,000 per candidate. The 2010 Citizens United case—which would unleash unlimited corporate spending in the path not taken—was decided differently here:

*Citizens United v. FEC* (2010): Supreme Court upheld campaign finance restrictions 6-3. Majority opinion by Justice Breyer: "The corrupting influence of concentrated wealth on democratic processes is well-documented. Congress has legitimate interest in maintaining electoral integrity and ensuring that all citizens, not just the wealthy, have meaningful voice in elections. Restricting corporate independent expenditures is narrowly tailored to achieve this compelling interest."

The decision preserved limits on corporate political spending, preventing the flood of dark money that would poison politics in the path not taken.

**Coalition Governance Norms:** Congressional orientation for new members included two-day training on coalition governance—how to negotiate across party lines, how to build majority support, how to compromise without betraying principles. The norm was cooperation, not warfare.

**Media Pluralism:** The prevention of media consolidation (no 1996 Telecom Act concentration) combined with cooperative news organizations and Fairness Doctrine maintenance meant diverse media landscape:
- 68 cooperative news organizations
- 180 independent local newspapers (vs. 12 companies owning 80% of papers in path not taken)
- Public broadcasting robust (NPR/PBS funding $2.4B annually)
- Digital platforms regulated as common carriers, preventing algorithmic polarization

**Voter Engagement:** 
- Turnout (2010 midterms): 68% (vs. 41% in path not taken)
- Multi-party satisfaction: 82%
- Congressional approval: 66% (vs. 18% in path not taken)
- Political efficacy (feeling your vote matters): 78% (vs. 44% in path not taken)

The contrast was stark. Here, democracy felt functional, responsive, legitimate. There, partisan warfare, corporate capture, and voter suppression would create cynicism and disengagement.

## The Global Spread Accelerates

The success of the alternative model—surviving the 2008 crisis that devastated the path not taken—accelerated global adoption:

**Public Credit Systems (2012):** 
- Countries with OPC-model public credit: 96 (up from 82 in 2008)
- Latin America: 18 countries (avoided debt crises)
- Africa: 32 countries (debt-free development)
- Asia: 28 countries (including India, Indonesia, Vietnam)
- Eastern Europe: 14 countries (post-Soviet transition via public credit, not oligarchy)

**Multi-Party RCV:**
- Countries using ranked choice voting: 38 (up from 24 in 2004)
- Including: Canada (2006), UK (2009), Germany (expanded), Australia (expanded), New Zealand (maintained), Scandinavian countries, parts of Latin America

**Cooperative Economics:**
- Global cooperative workforce: 420 million workers (vs. 24 million in path not taken)
- International Cooperative Alliance membership: 142 countries
- Cooperative GDP: $12 trillion globally (8% of world GDP)

**Climate Action:**
- Countries with carbon pricing: 84 (vs. 12 in path not taken)
- Paris Agreement (would happen 2015): Groundwork being laid with aggressive targets
- Renewable energy global capacity: 840,000 MW (vs. 420,000 MW in path not taken)
- Coal decline global: -18% capacity (vs. +24% in path not taken)

## The Obama Administration's Record

President Obama's first term (2009-2012) operated with progressive coalition majorities:

**Major Legislation:**
- Green New Deal Act (2009): $944B over 10 years for climate action
- Universal Healthcare Act (2010): Public option universal coverage

- Renewable electricity: 48% (2008) → 76% (2012)
- Emissions: -28% (2008) → -42% (2012) vs. 1990

**Approval Ratings:**
- Presidential approval: 62% (2012)
- Congressional approval: 66% (2012)
- Direction of country: 74% right track (vs. 22% in path not taken)

## The 2012 Elections

Obama ran for re-election in a six-way race:

**First Round:**
- Barack Obama (D): 48.2%
- Mitt Romney (R): 24.4%
- Jill Stein (Green): 12.2%
- Gary Johnson (Libertarian): 8.8%
- Tom Harkin (Reform): 5.2%
- Others: 1.2%

**Final Round:**
- Barack Obama (D): 58.4%
- Mitt Romney (R): 41.6%

Obama won decisively with 342 electoral votes to Romney's 196. The coalition held and deepened.

**Congressional Results (2013-2014):**

**House:**
- Democrats: 212
- Republicans: 158
- Greens: 32
- Reform: 24
- Labor: 8
- Libertarians: 1

**Senate:**
- Democrats: 50
- Republicans: 30
- Greens: 12
- Reform: 6
- Labor: 2

The progressive coalition (Democrats-Greens-Labor) had 252 House seats (58%) and 64 Senate seats (64%). The mandate was clear: continue and deepen the transformation.

## The Deepening Continues

As 2012 ended, the divergence between timelines was comprehensive:

**This Timeline:** Renewable electricity 76%, emissions -42% vs. 1990, cooperative workforce 32.4%, universal healthcare, near-zero student debt, median income $142K, wealth $348K, unemployment 4.2%, Gini 0.344, Congressional approval 66%, climate crisis being addressed, multi-party democracy functional, no War on Terror, no surveillance state, no financial crisis.

**Path Not Taken:** Renewable electricity 12%, emissions +12% vs. 1990, cooperative workforce <1%, partial healthcare (85% covered), student debt $1.2 trillion, median income $72K, wealth $96K (still recovering from crisis), unemployment 7.8% (slow recovery), Gini 0.486, Congressional approval 18%, climate crisis accelerating, two-party polarization extreme, War on Terror ongoing, surveillance state expanding, financial crisis still recovering.

The difference wasn't marginal. It was systemic. Every indicator—economic, environmental, political, social—showed this timeline performing dramatically better. The architecture mattered. The choices made decades earlier were compounding into radically different outcomes.

The decade of deepening had strengthened the foundations and accelerated the transformation. The question for the next decade was: how far could it go?
