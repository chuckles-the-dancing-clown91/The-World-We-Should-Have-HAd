# Chapter 2: The Quiet Revolution

## 2.6 Economic Table: 1946-1955

### Comparative Economic Indicators

| Indicator | Public Money Timeline (1955) | Our Timeline (1955) | Divergence |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **GDP (billions, 2024 $)** | $2,840 | $2,650 | +7.2% |
| **GDP per capita (2024 $)** | $17,200 | $16,100 | +6.8% |
| **Unemployment rate** | 2.3% | 4.4% | -2.1 pts |
| **Inflation (avg annual)** | 1.4% | 2.8% | -1.4 pts |
| **Median household income (2024 $)** | $61,800 | $48,200 | +28.2% |
| **Homeownership rate** | 67% | 55% | +12 pts |
| **Personal savings rate** | 21.7% | 6.2% | +15.5 pts |
| **Household debt-to-income ratio** | 12% | 38% | -26 pts |
| **Union density** | 52% | 35% | +17 pts |

### Labor Market Dynamics

#### Wage Growth (1946-1955, cumulative real growth)

| Income Percentile | Public Money Timeline | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Bottom 10%** | +84% | +18% | +66 pts |
| **25th percentile** | +76% | +24% | +52 pts |
| **Median (50th)** | +68% | +28% | +40 pts |
| **75th percentile** | +58% | +31% | +27 pts |
| **Top 10%** | +42% | +38% | +4 pts |
| **Top 1%** | +28% | +52% | -24 pts |

**Analysis:**  
In the Public Money timeline, wage growth was inversely proportional to income level—the bottom gained most, the top gained least. In our timeline, the top gained most.

This wasn't redistribution through taxation. It was distribution through **elimination of extraction**. When companies stopped paying interest to banks, they had surplus to pay workers. When workers could access credit for homes and businesses, their bargaining power increased.

The result: shared prosperity, not captured prosperity.

#### Employment by Sector (% of total employment)

| Sector | Public Money (1955) | Our Timeline (1955) | Divergence |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Agriculture** | 8.2% | 10.4% | -2.2 pts |
| **Manufacturing** | 34.1% | 28.8% | +5.3 pts |
| **Construction** | 6.8% | 5.1% | +1.7 pts |
| **Transportation/Utilities** | 7.9% | 7.2% | +0.7 pts |
| **Wholesale/Retail** | 18.2% | 19.1% | -0.9 pts |
| **Finance/Insurance** | 2.1% | 4.8% | -2.7 pts |
| **Services** | 14.3% | 16.4% | -2.1 pts |
| **Government** | 8.4% | 8.2% | +0.2 pts |

**Key Insight:**  
The financial sector employed 2.1% of workers (vs. 4.8% in our timeline)—a 56% reduction. Those workers weren't unemployed; they moved to manufacturing, construction, and government (OPC employment).

The economy shifted from *financial intermediation* to *production*.

### Housing Market Indicators

#### Homeownership Rates by Income Quintile

| Income Quintile | Public Money (1955) | Our Timeline (1955) | Divergence |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Bottom 20%** | 34% | 18% | +16 pts |
| **Second 20%** | 58% | 42% | +16 pts |
| **Middle 20%** | 74% | 61% | +13 pts |
| **Fourth 20%** | 82% | 72% | +10 pts |
| **Top 20%** | 89% | 84% | +5 pts |

**Analysis:**  
The gap between top and bottom quintile homeownership was 55 percentage points in our timeline, but only 55 points in the Public Money timeline. Low-interest OPC mortgages enabled working-class homeownership.

#### Homeownership Rates by Race

| Demographic | Public Money (1955) | Our Timeline (1955) | Divergence |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **White households** | 71% | 62% | +9 pts |
| **Black households** | 48% | 38% | +10 pts |
| **Racial gap** | 23 pts | 24 pts | -1 pt |

**Critical Note:**  
The racial homeownership gap barely narrowed in percentage-point terms (23 vs. 24), BUT both groups' rates increased dramatically. Black homeownership rose 10 points, white rose 9 points.

This was rising-tide economics: all groups gained, with Black households gaining slightly more in percentage terms due to starting from lower base.

By contrast, in our timeline's 1945-2024 period, the Black-white homeownership gap actually *widened* from 24 points to 30 points.

#### Housing Affordability Metrics (1955)

| Metric | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Median home price (2024 $)** | $128,000 | $142,000 | -9.9% |
| **Median household income (2024 $)** | $61,800 | $48,200 | +28.2% |
| **Price-to-income ratio** | 2.07 | 2.95 | -30% |
| **Monthly mortgage payment (median, 2024 $)** | $284 | $612 | -53.6% |
| **Mortgage payment as % of income** | 5.5% | 15.2% | -9.7 pts |

**Analysis:**  
In the Public Money timeline, the median family spent 5.5% of income on housing. In our timeline: 15.2%.

This 9.7-percentage-point difference meant an extra $500/month (2024 dollars) of disposable income—available for savings, education, healthcare, or consumption.

That extra income compounded over lifetimes, creating the massive wealth divergence documented in the Divergence Ledger.

### Financial Sector Metrics

#### Banking Sector Statistics (1955)

| Indicator | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Banking assets (% of GDP)** | 18% | 42% | -24 pts |
| **Banking employment** | 520,000 | 1,450,000 | -64% |
| **Bank profits (% of GDP)** | 0.4% | 1.8% | -1.4 pts |
| **Bank failures (1946-1955)** | 0 | 127 | -127 |
| **Average bank ROE** | 4.2% | 11.8% | -7.6 pts |

**Analysis:**  
Banks became utilities: low return, low risk, stable. They weren't "destroyed"—they were rightsized.

The 1.4% of GDP that had been banking profits was redistributed:
- 0.6% went to higher wages
- 0.5% went to lower consumer prices (businesses paid less interest)
- 0.3% went to government revenue (OPC surplus)

#### Credit Allocation: OPC vs. Private Banks (1955)

| Credit Type | OPC (Public Money) | Private Banks (Our Timeline) | Rate Difference |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Residential mortgages** | 0.5% | 4.8% | -4.3 pts |
| **Commercial real estate** | 1.2% | 5.5% | -4.3 pts |
| **Business expansion** | 1.5% | 6.2% | -4.7 pts |
| **Agricultural** | 0.8% | 5.0% | -4.2 pts |
| **Infrastructure** | 0.3% | 4.5% | -4.2 pts |
| **Consumer credit** | N/A | 12-18% | N/A |

**Average interest rate savings: 4.3 percentage points**

Over a 20-year mortgage of $100,000 (2024 dollars):
- **Our timeline (4.8%):** Total payment: $157,800 (interest: $57,800)
- **Public Money (0.5%):** Total payment: $105,200 (interest: $5,200)
- **Savings: $52,600 per mortgage**

Multiply this by 15 million mortgages issued 1946-1955, and the total savings to American families was approximately **$789 billion** (2024 dollars).

That wealth stayed with families, rather than being extracted by banks.

### Wealth Distribution

#### Household Wealth by Percentile (1955, median, 2024 $)

| Percentile | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Bottom 20%** | $8,400 | $1,200 | +$7,200 |
| **20-40%** | $28,600 | $12,800 | +$15,800 |
| **40-60%** | $52,000 | $31,400 | +$20,600 |
| **60-80%** | $89,200 | $58,700 | +$30,500 |
| **80-95%** | $168,000 | $124,000 | +$44,000 |
| **95-99%** | $384,000 | $342,000 | +$42,000 |
| **Top 1%** | $1,280,000 | $1,520,000 | -$240,000 |

**Analysis:**  
Every group except the top 1% had more wealth in the Public Money timeline.

The bottom 20% had **7 times** more wealth.  
The middle class (40-60%) had **66% more** wealth.  
The top 1% had **16% less** wealth.

This wasn't confiscatory taxation. This was structural: when you eliminate extraction through credit creation, wealth distributes more evenly.

#### Wealth Share by Percentile (1955)

| Percentile | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Bottom 50%** | 18.2% | 6.4% | +11.8 pts |
| **50-90%** | 42.6% | 36.8% | +5.8 pts |
| **Top 10%** | 39.2% | 56.8% | -17.6 pts |
| **Top 1%** | 12.4% | 28.2% | -15.8 pts |

**Key Insight:**  
In our timeline, the top 1% held 28.2% of all wealth. In the Public Money timeline: 12.4%.

That 15.8-percentage-point difference represented approximately **$840 billion** (2024 dollars) that stayed with the bottom 90% rather than concentrating at the top.

### Racial Economic Indicators

#### Black-White Income Gap (1955, median household)

| Metric | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **White median income (2024 $)** | $64,200 | $51,800 | +24.0% |
| **Black median income (2024 $)** | $47,800 | $28,400 | +68.3% |
| **Black-as-%-of-white** | 74.5% | 54.8% | +19.7 pts |

**Analysis:**  
Both groups gained, but Black households gained more (68% vs. 24%) because OPC credit was non-discriminatory.

In our timeline, the Black-white income ratio in 2024 would be 61%—barely improved from 1955's 54.8%.

In the Public Money timeline, the ratio was already 74.5% by 1955 and would continue narrowing.

#### Black-White Wealth Gap (1955, median household)

| Metric | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **White median wealth (2024 $)** | $52,000 | $45,000 | +15.6% |
| **Black median wealth (2024 $)** | $23,000 | $6,800 | +238.2% |
| **Black-as-%-of-white** | 44.2% | 15.1% | +29.1 pts |

**Critical Finding:**  
The wealth gap narrowed dramatically—from a 6.6:1 ratio in our timeline to a 2.3:1 ratio in the Public Money timeline.

This was the most important economic divergence of the entire 1946-1955 period. Wealth is multigenerational. The Black families who built equity in 1946-1955 would pass it to children and grandchildren.

In our timeline, redlining and credit discrimination prevented this wealth accumulation, creating a racial wealth gap that would persist for 70+ years.

In this timeline, the gap began closing in the first decade.

### Productivity and Wage Coupling

#### Productivity vs. Wage Growth (1946-1955, cumulative)

| Indicator | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Labor productivity growth** | +42% | +38% | +4 pts |
| **Real median wage growth** | +68% | +28% | +40 pts |
| **Wage-productivity coupling** | 1.62x | 0.74x | +0.88x |

**Analysis:**  
In our timeline, productivity grew 38% but wages grew only 28%—a 0.74x coupling ratio. Workers produced more but captured less.

In the Public Money timeline, productivity grew 42% and wages grew 68%—a 1.62x ratio. Workers produced more *and captured more than their productivity gains*.

How? Because employers weren't paying interest to banks, they had surplus to share. And because unions were strong (52% density), they negotiated productivity-sharing agreements.

This was the "wage-productivity coupling" that, in our timeline, would break completely after 1973.

### Government Fiscal Position

#### Federal Budget Metrics (1955)

| Indicator | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Federal revenue (% GDP)** | 19.2% | 16.8% | +2.4 pts |
| **Federal spending (% GDP)** | 18.8% | 17.4% | +1.4 pts |
| **Federal surplus/deficit (% GDP)** | +0.4% | -0.6% | +1.0 pts |
| **Interest on debt (% GDP)** | 0.3% | 1.8% | -1.5 pts |
| **Federal debt (% GDP)** | 42% | 68% | -26 pts |

**Analysis:**  
The Public Money timeline ran a surplus, not through austerity, but through elimination of interest payments.

In our timeline, 1.8% of GDP went to interest on federal debt—paid to bondholders (mostly banks and wealthy individuals).

In the Public Money timeline, the OPC financed government credit at near-zero interest. That 1.5% of GDP was available for:
- Social programs (+0.6% of GDP)
- Infrastructure (+0.5% of GDP)
- Debt reduction (+0.4% of GDP)

The "fiscal crisis" narrative that would dominate our timeline's politics never emerged, because government financing costs were negligible.

### Infrastructure Investment

#### Public Infrastructure Spending (1946-1955, cumulative % of GDP)

| Category | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Transportation (roads, rail, airports)** | 12.8% | 7.2% | +5.6 pts |
| **Water/sewer systems** | 4.2% | 2.1% | +2.1 pts |
| **Electrical grid** | 3.6% | 2.4% | +1.2 pts |
| **Public transit** | 2.8% | 1.1% | +1.7 pts |
| **Schools/hospitals** | 5.4% | 3.8% | +1.6 pts |
| **Total infrastructure** | 28.8% | 16.6% | +12.2 pts |

**Analysis:**  
Over 10 years (1946-1955), the Public Money timeline invested an additional 12.2% of GDP in infrastructure—approximately **$320 billion** (2024 dollars).

This wasn't deficit spending. It was OPC credit issued at near-zero interest, repaid through user fees and tax revenue over 30-40 years.

The result: America entered the 1960s with world-class infrastructure, a generation ahead of schedule.

### Consumer Spending Patterns

#### Household Expenditure Distribution (1955, % of income)

| Category | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Housing (rent/mortgage)** | 12% | 18% | -6 pts |
| **Food** | 24% | 26% | -2 pts |
| **Transportation** | 11% | 13% | -2 pts |
| **Healthcare** | 6% | 5% | +1 pt |
| **Education** | 3% | 2% | +1 pt |
| **Debt service (non-mortgage)** | 1% | 8% | -7 pts |
| **Savings** | 22% | 6% | +16 pts |
| **Discretionary** | 21% | 22% | -1 pt |

**Key Finding:**  
Families in the Public Money timeline spent 6% less on housing and 7% less on debt service, freeing up 13% of income for savings (16 percentage points more than our timeline).

This wasn't asceticism—discretionary spending was nearly identical (21% vs. 22%). Families weren't sacrificing consumption; they just weren't paying interest to banks.

### Small Business Formation

#### New Business Starts (1946-1955, total)

| Metric | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Total new businesses** | 4,280,000 | 2,840,000 | +50.7% |
| **5-year survival rate** | 72% | 50% | +22 pts |
| **Businesses with employees** | 1,620,000 | 980,000 | +65.3% |
| **Avg. employees per new business** | 6.8 | 4.2 | +61.9% |

**Analysis:**  
Access to OPC business credit at 1.5% interest (vs. 6-8% from private banks) meant:
- More people could afford to start businesses
- Businesses were better capitalized and more likely to survive
- Businesses grew faster (hired more employees)

The result: a more entrepreneurial, less concentrated economy.

### Education Outcomes

#### Educational Attainment (population 25+, 1955)

| Level | Public Money | Our Timeline | Divergence |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **High school graduate** | 64% | 59% | +5 pts |
| **Some college** | 28% | 19% | +9 pts |
| **Bachelor's degree** | 12% | 8% | +4 pts |
| **Advanced degree** | 4% | 3% | +1 pt |

**Analysis:**  
Educational credit (0% interest loans starting 1952) increased college enrollment significantly. This was early in the divergence, but the trend was clear: education would become more accessible without becoming financialized.

### International Comparison

#### U.S. vs. Other Developed Nations (1955, GDP per capita, 2024 $)

| Country | Public Money U.S. | Our Timeline U.S. | Divergence | Other Countries (1955) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------------|
| **USA** | $17,200 | $16,100 | +6.8% | — |
| **UK** | — | — | — | $10,800 |
| **France** | — | — | — | $9,400 |
| **West Germany** | — | — | — | $8,900 |
| **Japan** | — | — | — | $4,200 |

**Note:**  
The U.S. maintained its post-war advantage in both timelines, but the Public Money timeline saw faster domestic growth. Other nations' figures are identical in both timelines at this point (divergence was domestic only through 1955).

However, as we'll see in subsequent chapters, the Public Money system would be exported through international development programs, creating global divergence by the 1960s.

### The Bottom Line: Who Won, Who Lost (1946-1955)

#### Winners (households that gained wealth relative to our timeline):

| Group | Wealth Gain (2024 $, median) | % Gain |
|-------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Bottom 20%** | +$7,200 | +600% |
| **20-40%** | +$15,800 | +123% |
| **40-60%** | +$20,600 | +66% |
| **60-80%** | +$30,500 | +52% |
| **80-95%** | +$44,000 | +35% |
| **95-99%** | +$42,000 | +12% |

**Total households in winning coalition: 99%**

#### Losers (households that lost wealth relative to our timeline):

| Group | Wealth Loss (2024 $, median) | % Loss |
|-------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Top 1%** | -$240,000 | -16% |

**Total households in losing coalition: 1%**

**Political Implication:**  
A system that makes 99% of the population materially better off is politically invincible.

The top 1% had money and influence, but they couldn't win elections against 99% of voters who were experiencing tangible prosperity.

This was the structural basis for the quiet revolution's permanence.

### Methodological Note

All figures in this table are constructed from:
- Historical data (for our timeline)
- Structural extrapolation (for Public Money timeline, based on documented changes in interest rates, credit allocation, employment patterns)
- Conservative estimates (where uncertainty exists, lower-bound divergence is reported)

The divergence is likely *understated* rather than overstated. The cascading effects of eliminating private credit creation touched every aspect of economic life, many in ways difficult to quantify precisely.

But the direction is indisputable: **eliminating extraction enabled shared prosperity**.
