# Chapter 6: The Middle-Class Century

## 6.3 Time to Live: Leisure, Culture, and the Art of Being Human

### The 40-Hour Week That Held

In our timeline, the 40-hour workweek—won through labor struggles in the 1930s-40s—gradually eroded:

**Average Annual Hours Worked (Full-Time Workers):**
- 1950: 1,920 hours (38 hours/week)
- 1970: 1,880 hours
- 1990: 1,960 hours
- 2010: 2,080 hours
- 2024: 2,180 hours (42 hours/week, often more with unpaid overtime)

**The trend:** Backward. More hours, not fewer.

**This Timeline:**

- 1950: 1,920 hours
- 1965: 1,840 hours (35.4 hours/week)
- 1980: 1,760 hours (projected, Chapter 7)
- Trend: **Downward**. Fewer hours, more leisure.

**Why the Difference?**

### The Architecture of Leisure: How Time Was Created

**1. Strong Unions (52% density):**
- Negotiated hours limits
- Enforced 40-hour week maximum
- Overtime at 1.5x (strictly enforced)
- Vacation time standard (2-3 weeks by 1965)

**2. No Leverage for Extraction:**
- Companies couldn't borrow to finance expansion
- Had to operate within cash flow
- Couldn't squeeze workers for extra hours to service debt
- Profit pressure lower (no financial engineering demands)

**3. Worker Board Representation:**
- Workers had voice in scheduling decisions
- Pushed for reasonable hours
- Protected work-life balance

**4. Strong Minimum Wage:**
- $1.60/hour (1965) = living wage
- Workers didn't need excessive overtime to survive
- 40 hours = sufficient income

**5. Cultural Norm:**
- Overwork seen as management failure (couldn't organize efficiently)
- Work-life balance valued
- Community participation expected

**The Result:**

**By 1965:**
- 87% of workers: 40 hours/week or less
- 12% of workers: 41-45 hours/week
- 1% of workers: 45+ hours/week

**Our Timeline (1965):**
- 68% of workers: 40 hours/week or less
- 24% of workers: 41-45 hours/week
- 8% of workers: 45+ hours/week

**Difference:** More people working reasonable hours, fewer trapped in overtime grind.

### What People Did With Time: The Leisure Explosion

More time + more money (wages tracked productivity) = **leisure boom**.

**Recreation Spending (% of Income):**
- 1950: 4.2%
- 1965: 6.8%
- Growth: +62%

**Our Timeline:**
- 1950: 4.2%
- 1965: 5.1%
- Growth: +21%

**This timeline spent more on leisure—but what did that mean?**

### The Public Recreation Infrastructure: 1950-1965

Government invested in leisure infrastructure, recognizing rest as necessity.

**National Parks:**
- 1950: 42 parks, 33 million visitors
- 1965: 58 parks, 72 million visitors
- Investment: $840 million (1960-65, 2024: $8.2B)

**State Parks:**
- 1950: 1,240 parks
- 1965: 2,680 parks (+116%)
- Accessible to 85% of population within 50 miles

**Municipal Parks and Recreation:**
- Community centers: 4,200 → 8,400 (+100%)
- Swimming pools (public): 3,800 → 7,200 (+89%)
- Sports facilities: 6,400 → 12,800 (+100%)
- Playgrounds: 14,200 → 24,600 (+73%)

**Why the Boom?**

**1. Tax Revenue:**
- Strong economy = strong tax base
- Homeownership 67% = stable property tax
- Progressive income tax on top earners

**2. Political Priority:**
- Middle-class voters demanded public amenities
- Recreation seen as public good (like roads, schools)
- Bipartisan support

**3. Community Wealth:**
- Prosperous communities invested in themselves
- Parks, pools, centers = shared wealth visible

### The Vacation: From Luxury to Expectation

**Paid Vacation Time (1965):**

| Years Employed | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| 0-5 years | 10 days | 7 days | +3 days |
| 5-10 years | 15 days | 10 days | +5 days |
| 10-20 years | 20 days | 14 days | +6 days |
| 20+ years | 25 days | 17 days | +8 days |

**Why More Vacation?**

- Union contracts standard: 2 weeks minimum
- Many companies offered 3 weeks (competition for workers)
- Some cooperatives: 4 weeks (worker-owners voted themselves time)

**Vacation Participation Rate:**
- This timeline (1965): 72% took annual vacation of 1+ weeks

**Psychological Impact:**
- Break from work routine
- Family bonding
- Exposure to different places/cultures
- Renewal, rest
- **Something to look forward to**

**The library as community anchor**—education, culture, gathering space.

### The Sports: Participation, Not Just Spectacle

Sports boomed—but differently than our timeline's passive consumption model.

**Youth Sports Participation (Ages 6-18, 1965):**
- This timeline: 68%
- Our timeline: 52%
- Difference: +16 percentage points

**Why Higher?**

**1. Public Infrastructure:**
- Parks, fields, pools, gyms—publicly funded
- Free or low-cost ($5-10/season)
- Accessible regardless of income

**2. Time:**
- Parents worked 40 hours (not 50+)
- Could coach, attend games
- Kids had time after school (not working to help family finances)

**3. Community Focus:**
- Sports integrated into community life
- Not professionalized at young ages
- Emphasis on participation, fun, fitness

**Adult Participation:**

**Recreational Sports (1965, adults):**

**Professional Sports Attendance:**

**Average Annual Attendance (per capita):**
- This timeline: 2.8 events/year
- Our timeline: 2.4 events/year
- Difference: +17%

**But:** Tickets more affordable ($6-12, 2024: $58-117), stadiums publicly funded, seen as community assets not profit centers.

### Television: Limited but Quality

TV existed by 1965, but differently.

**TV Ownership:**
- This timeline: 88% of households
- Our timeline: 93%
- Difference: -5 percentage points (slightly lower)

**Why Lower?** People had more **alternatives**—parks, libraries, community activities, theaters.

**TV Programming:**

**Channels Available (1965):**
- ABC, CBS, NBC (national networks)
- PBS (public broadcasting, strong funding)
- Local stations (community-oriented)
- Average household: 5-7 channels (vs. 4-6 in our timeline)

**Programming:**

- Drama: High quality (funded by advertisers, but also PBS)
- Educational: Children's programming (PBS priority)
- Sports: Weekend games (not every night)

**Viewing Time (1965):**
- This timeline: 3.2 hours/day
- Our timeline: 4.8 hours/day
- Difference: -33%

**Why Less?** More leisure alternatives, less passive consumption, cultural norm against excessive TV.

### The Social Life: Community Over Consumption

The most dramatic difference: **How people spent time together**.

**Social Activities (1965, % participating monthly):**

| Activity | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Church/religious gathering** | 64% | 68% | -4 pts |
| **Community meetings** | 42% | 28% | +14 pts |
| **Club meetings** (Rotary, Lions, etc.) | 38% | 32% | +6 pts |
| **Sports leagues** (bowling, softball) | 34% | 24% | +10 pts |
| **Dinner parties at home** | 58% | 48% | +10 pts |
| **Block parties/neighborhood events** | 28% | 18% | +10 pts |
| **Union meetings** | 52% | 28% | +24 pts |
| **Cooperative meetings** | 8.4% | 0% | +8.4 pts |
| **Volunteer activities** | 46% | 38% | +8 pts |

**The Pattern:** More **organized social participation**, more **community engagement**.

**Why?**

**1. Time:**
- 40-hour week = evenings free
- Not exhausted from overwork
- Could participate

**2. Stability:**
- Secure jobs, stable communities
- People stayed in place (not constant moving for work)
- Could build relationships

**3. Ownership:**
- Homeownership 67% = investment in community
- Cooperative membership 8.4% = governance participation
- Stakeholder mentality

**4. Infrastructure:**
- Meeting spaces (libraries, community centers, union halls, cooperative buildings)
- Free or low-cost
- Designed for gathering

**Case Study: The Martinez Family (1963):**

**Robert Martinez, age 38, steelworker-owner (cooperative)**
**Maria Martinez, age 36, teacher**
**Two children, ages 8 and 11**

**Typical Week (Social/Leisure Activities):**

**Monday:**
- Evening: Little League practice (Robert coaches, son plays)

**Tuesday:**
- Evening: Teacher's union meeting (Maria)

**Wednesday:**
- Evening: Cooperative board meeting (Robert, elected member)
- Kids: Library story hour

**Thursday:**
- Evening: Family dinner with neighbors (rotating houses)

**Friday:**
- Evening: Movie night at home (rented from library)

**Saturday:**
- Morning: Little League game
- Afternoon: Yard work, errands
- Evening: Dinner party at home (friends from church)

**Sunday:**
- Morning: Church
- Afternoon: City park, picnic with extended family
- Evening: Prepare for week

**Total Social/Community Time:** ~18 hours/week

**Compare to Our Timeline's Martinez Equivalent (2024):**
- Robert works 50 hours (including commute)
- Maria works 45 hours (grading at home)
- Kids have scheduled activities (expensive)
- Parents exhausted evenings
- Weekend: Errands, catch-up, recovery
- Total Social/Community Time: ~4 hours/week

**Difference:** 14 hours/week more community engagement.

### The Artists: Making a Living Making Art

The prosperity enabled more artists to actually **sustain themselves**.

**Self-Identified Artists (1965):**
- Writers: 42,000 (vs. 28,000)
- Visual artists: 68,000 (vs. 48,000)
- Musicians: 84,000 (vs. 62,000)
- Theater artists: 24,000 (vs. 18,000)
- Total: 218,000 (vs. 156,000)

**Difference:** +40%

**How Did They Survive?**

**1. Arts Funding:**
- National Endowment for the Arts (1965): $8.4M (2024: $82M)
- State arts councils: $24M combined
- Municipal arts funding: $38M
- Total: $70.4M public arts funding

**2. Patronage:**
- Middle-class purchased art (disposable income available)
- Local businesses commissioned work (community pride)
- Cooperatives funded murals, sculptures (worker culture)

**3. Teaching:**
- Public schools employed artists (arts education valued)
- Community centers offered classes
- Private lessons (piano, guitar, etc.)

**4. Commercial Work:**
- Advertising, design, illustration
- Publishing (magazines, books)
- Theater, film, TV

**5. Hybrid Models:**
- Day job (40 hours) + art (evenings/weekends)
- Sustainable because 40-hour week left time
- Not exhausted, could create

**Case Study: Eleanor Wright, Painter (1958-1965):**

**1958:** Art school graduate, moved to New York
**Income Sources (1965):**
- Gallery sales: $4,200/year (3-4 paintings sold)
- Teaching (community center): $3,600/year (part-time)
- Commercial illustration: $2,400/year (occasional)
- **Total:** $10,200/year (2024: $99,000)

**Expenses:**
- Rent (studio apartment): $1,440/year (2024: $14,000)
- Studio space (shared): $720/year
- Food: $1,200/year
- Art supplies: $840/year
- Other: $1,200/year
- **Total:** $5,400/year

**Surplus:** $4,800/year (saved for down payment)

**Could she survive as artist?** Yes. Modestly, but sustainably.

**Our Timeline:** Most artists can't survive on art income alone—forced into full-time day jobs, art becomes hobby or abandoned.

### Westbeth: The Artists' Cooperative (1965)

In New York's West Village, 384 units of affordable artist housing—created by cooperative structure.

**The Model:**
- Building: Former Bell Telephone Laboratories, converted 1965
- Ownership: Limited-equity cooperative
- Financing: OPC credit (2.5%, 30 years)
- Rent: $180-240/month (2024: $1,750-2,300) — 30% below market
- Residents: Artists only (juried selection)

**The Impact:**
- 384 artist households could afford to live in NYC
- Community formed: Mutual support, collaboration, exhibitions
- Cultural production: Paintings, sculptures, plays, music
- National model: 42 similar artist cooperatives by 1975

**Without Westbeth (our timeline's reality):**
- Artists priced out of cities
- Cultural production concentrated among wealthy
- Art becomes luxury commodity, not community asset

**With Westbeth:**
- Artists remain in cities
- Culture democratized
- Art integrated into community life

### What Leisure and Culture Proved

**Five Lessons:**

**1. Time Is the Foundation:**
- 40-hour week (enforced) = time for life
- Overwork destroys community, culture, family
- Leisure requires protection

**2. Public Investment Creates Access:**
- Parks, libraries, pools, theaters—publicly funded
- Accessible regardless of income
- Shared wealth visible

**3. Participation > Consumption:**
- More people **doing** (sports, arts, community)
- Less passive consumption (TV)
- Engagement creates meaning

**4. Artists Need Support:**
- Funding + patronage + time = sustainable art careers
- Culture flourishes when artists can survive
- Art is community asset, not luxury

**5. Community Requires Infrastructure:**
- Meeting spaces, parks, centers—physical places to gather
- Free or low-cost access essential
- Architecture enables social connection

### The Daily Life: What It Felt Like

**Evening (6:30 PM, Tuesday, 1963):**

**James Thompson, factory worker-owner:**
- Home from work by 5:15 PM (short commute, 40-hour week)
- Dinner with family: 6:00 PM
- 7:00 PM: Drives son to Little League practice
- 7:30 PM: Attends cooperative board meeting (elected treasurer)
- 9:00 PM: Home, reads newspaper, listens to radio
- 10:30 PM: Bed

**Compare to Our Timeline (2024):**
- Home from work by 7:00 PM (long commute, 50-hour week)
- Microwaved dinner: 7:15 PM
- Watches TV, exhausted
- 11:00 PM: Bed
- No time for community, family, engagement

**Weekend (Saturday, 1963):**

**Martinez Family:**
- 9:00 AM: Farmer's market (local produce, community gathering)
- 11:00 AM: Little League game (parents watch, neighbors attend)
- 1:00 PM: Lunch at home
- 3:00 PM: City park (swimming, picnic with extended family)
- 6:00 PM: Dinner at home
- 8:00 PM: Neighbors visit, play cards

**Compare to Our Timeline (2024):**
- 9:00 AM: Costco run (bulk shopping, isolated)
- 11:00 AM: Kids' travel soccer (expensive, requires driving 45 minutes)
- 2:00 PM: Errands, catch-up
- 6:00 PM: Takeout
- 8:00 PM: Netflix, isolated

**The Difference:** Community vs. isolation. Engagement vs. exhaustion. Living vs. surviving.

---

By 1965, the middle class had not just economic security—they had **time to live**.

Time to read, create, play, gather, participate.

Time to be human, not just productive.

The architecture that created prosperity also created **space for life itself**.
