# Chapter 6: The Middle-Class Century

## 6.4 Democracy Deepened: When Ownership Meets Citizenship

### The Voting Paradox of Our Timeline

In our timeline, despite universal suffrage, democratic participation declined:

**Voter Turnout (Presidential Elections):**
- 1960: 62.8%
- 1980: 54.2%
- 2000: 54.2%
- 2020: 66.8% (spike, but...)
- Average 1960-2020: 57.2%

**Midterm Elections:**
- Average: 40-45%

**Local Elections:**
- Average: 20-35%

**The Pattern:** Disengagement, apathy, alienation.

**This Timeline:**

**Voter Turnout (Presidential Elections):**
- 1960: 68.4%
- 1980: 72.2% (projected, Chapter 7)
- Average 1960-1965: 69.2%

**Midterm Elections:**
- Average: 58-62%

**Local Elections:**
- Average: 48-54%

**The Pattern:** Higher, rising engagement.

**Why the Difference?**

### The Stakeholder Theory of Democracy

**The Hypothesis:** Ownership creates engagement.

When people own homes, own stakes in their workplaces, own shares in their communities—they vote. They participate. They **have something to protect and improve**.

**The Evidence (1965):**

**Voter Turnout by Homeownership:**
- Homeowners: 74% turnout
- Renters: 48% turnout
- Difference: +26 percentage points

**Voter Turnout by Workplace:**
- Worker-owners (cooperatives): 82% turnout
- Union members (with board seats): 76% turnout
- Non-union workers: 58% turnout
- Difference: +24 percentage points (cooperative vs. non-union)

**Voter Turnout by Combined Status:**
- Homeowner + worker-owner: 86% turnout
- Homeowner + union member: 80% turnout
- Renter + non-union: 44% turnout
- Difference: +42 percentage points (top vs. bottom)

**The Pattern:** Ownership correlates with participation.

**But Correlation ≠ Causation. What's the mechanism?**

### The Mechanisms of Engagement

**1. Direct Stake in Policy Outcomes:**

**Property Taxes:**
- Homeowners pay directly (not hidden in rent)
- School funding, local services visible
- Vote on levies, bonds
- **Result:** Engaged in local government

**Worker Board Representation:**
- Union members vote on board seats
- See direct connection: Vote → Policy → Wages/Conditions
- **Result:** Engaged in workplace governance, transfers to political

**Cooperative Governance:**
- One member, one vote (democratic training)
- Monthly meetings, decisions on operations
- **Result:** Democracy as practice, not theory

**2. Time to Participate:**

**40-Hour Week:**
- Evenings free for meetings, canvassing, organizing
- Not exhausted from overwork
- Can attend town halls, school boards

**Economic Security:**
- Not working multiple jobs to survive
- Can take time to vote, volunteer, engage
- Mental bandwidth available

**3. Information Access:**

**Strong Local Media:**
- Newspapers covered local government thoroughly
- No consolidation (Fairness Doctrine maintained, Chapter 7)
- Community knew what was happening

**Union Communications:**
- Union newspapers, meetings
- Political education part of union culture
- Issues explained, candidates vetted

**Cooperative Communications:**
- Monthly newsletters
- Board meeting summaries
- Governance transparency

**4. Social Capital:**

**Community Stability:**
- Homeownership 67% = people stayed put
- Built relationships with neighbors
- Knew local officials, issues

**Organizational Membership:**
- Unions 52%, cooperatives 8.4%, churches, clubs
- Organizations mobilized members
- Collective action easier

**5. Efficacy Belief:**

**Winning:**
- New Deal policies **worked**
- Housing affordable, jobs good, education accessible
- People believed government **could solve problems**
- **Result:** Worth engaging

**Our Timeline:**
- 1970s-2020s: Government increasingly **failed** to deliver
- Wages stagnated, housing unaffordable, debt mounted
- People believed government **couldn't or wouldn't help**
- **Result:** Why bother?

### The Local Democracy: Where It Mattered Most

National politics got attention, but **local politics shaped daily life**.

**School Board Elections (1965):**

**Turnout:**
- This timeline: 52%
- Our timeline: 28%
- Difference: +24 percentage points

**Why Higher?**

**1. Schools Mattered:**
- Well-funded, high-quality
- Parents saw connection: Vote → Board → Funding → Quality
- Direct stake

**2. Property Tax Visibility:**
- Homeowners voted on school levies
- Tax burden visible, accountability demanded

**3. Community Investment:**
- Children's education = community's future
- Stakeholder mentality

**City Council Elections:**

**Turnout:**
- This timeline: 48%
- Our timeline: 22%
- Difference: +26 percentage points

**Why?**

**1. Zoning Decisions:**
- Homeowners cared about neighborhood character
- Fought sprawl, protected residential areas
- Attended hearings

**2. Public Services:**
- Parks, libraries, pools, recreation
- Middle-class used and valued these
- Defended funding

**3. Economic Development:**
- Jobs, businesses, tax base
- Union members and worker-owners engaged
- Wanted sustainable, community-serving development

**Case Study: Millville City Council Race (1962):**

**The Issue:** Developer proposed demolishing 240 units of affordable housing to build luxury apartments.

**The Stakeholders:**
- **Residents:** Tenants (would be displaced) + homeowners (feared neighborhood change)
- **Union:** Construction workers (worried about residential stability)
- **Cooperative:** Grocery co-op nearby (customer base)
- **Church:** Community anchor, served low-income families

**The Campaign:**
- Coalition formed: Residents + union + co-op + church
- Organized: 840 people attended city council meetings over 4 months
- Turnout: 64% (usually 42%)
- **Result:** Council voted 5-2 against development, negotiated community land trust instead (Chapter 4)

**The Lesson:** Organized stakeholders could win.

**Our Timeline's Equivalent (2015-2020s):**
- Gentrification bulldozes working-class neighborhoods
- Residents displaced, can't afford to stay
- City councils bow to developers (campaign contributions)
- Turnout 15-20%, mostly wealthy homeowners
- **Result:** Communities destroyed

### The Municipal Experiments: Direct Democracy (1960-1965)

Some cities experimented with **deeper democracy**—not just elections, but participation.

**Participatory Budgeting (Introduced 1963):**

**The Model:**
- Originated: Cambridge, Massachusetts (1963)
- Concept: Citizens directly decide how to spend portion of city budget
- Process:
  - Public assemblies (neighborhood meetings)
  - Idea proposals (residents suggest projects)
  - Delegate committees (elected to develop proposals)
  - Community vote (all residents vote on final projects)

**Cambridge (1963-1965):**
- Budget: $2.4 million (10% of discretionary budget)
- Participation: 12,400 residents (32% of population)
- Projects funded: Playgrounds (4), library renovation, community center, youth programs, street repairs

**Results:**
- Voter turnout (subsequent elections): +14 percentage points
- Civic engagement (meeting attendance): +28%
- Trust in government: +18 percentage points
- **Pattern:** Participation breeds more participation

**Spread:**
- By 1965: 8 cities experimenting (Berkeley, Ann Arbor, Madison, Burlington, etc.)
- Bipartisan support (good governance, not partisan)

**Why Worked?**

**1. Direct Impact:**
- Residents saw results: "I voted for that playground, now it exists"
- Efficacy reinforced

**2. Education:**
- Budget process transparent
- Citizens learned trade-offs, constraints
- Demands became realistic

**3. Community Building:**
- Meetings created social connections
- Neighbors met, organized
- Social capital strengthened

### The Ranked Choice Voting Experiments (1960-1965)

While federal RCV wouldn't come until 1994 (Chapter 10), some municipalities experimented early.

**Cambridge, MA (1960):**
- Adopted RCV for city council elections
- Multi-member districts, proportional representation
- **Result:** More diverse council (ideological and demographic), higher turnout

**Berkeley, CA (1962):**
- Adopted RCV for mayor, city council
- **Result:** Third-party candidates viable, coalition governance

**Ann Arbor, MI (1965):**
- Adopted RCV for school board
- **Result:** Parent candidates (non-politicians) could win

**The Pattern:** RCV enabled more voices, reduced polarization, increased participation.

**These experiments would prove critical in 1980s-90s arguments for federal adoption** (Chapters 10-11).

### The Union as Political School

Unions didn't just bargain wages—they **taught democracy**.

**Union Meeting Attendance (1965):**
- Average member: 8 meetings/year
- 52% density = 32 million workers attending

**What Happened at Meetings?**

**1. Democratic Practice:**
- Robert's Rules of Order
- Motions, debates, votes
- Parliamentary procedure learned by doing

**2. Political Education:**
- Speakers on issues (healthcare, housing, education)
- Candidate forums (members questioned politicians)
- Issue research presented, debated

**3. Collective Decision-Making:**
- Contract negotiations discussed
- Strike votes (democratic, serious)
- Endorsements debated, voted

**4. Leadership Development:**
- Members ran for union office
- Shop stewards elected
- Skills: Public speaking, organizing, negotiating

**The Transfer Effect:**

**Union Members vs. Non-Members (1965):**

| Indicator | Union | Non-Union | Difference |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Voter turnout** | 76% | 58% | +18 pts |
| **Contact elected officials** | 42% | 22% | +20 pts |
| **Attend town hall** | 38% | 18% | +20 pts |
| **Volunteer for campaign** | 24% | 8% | +16 pts |
| **Run for local office** | 3.2% | 0.8% | +2.4 pts |

**The Pattern:** Union membership = political engagement training.

**Case Study: Sarah Martinez (1958-1965):**

**1958:** Hired at garment factory, joined union (mandatory, closed shop)

**1959:** Attended first union meeting
- Elected shop steward (volunteered, training provided)

**1961:** Led grievance process (coworker wrongly terminated, won reinstatement)
- Learned: Organizing, advocacy, negotiation

**1962:** Ran for union executive board (lost, but learned campaigning)

**1963:** Elected to school board (first campaign, won 52%)
- Skills from union: Public speaking, coalition-building, parliamentary procedure

**1965:** School board president
- Fought for teacher raises, new school construction
- Union training → political leadership

**The Lesson:** Unions were **democracy schools**, producing civically engaged citizens.

### The Cooperative as Democracy Lab

Cooperatives operated on **one member, one vote**—pure democracy in economic sphere.

**Cooperative Governance (1965):**

**Monthly Meetings:**
- Average attendance: 42% of members (high for voluntary organizations)
- Agenda: Operations, finances, policy decisions
- Votes: Budget, capital investments, pay scales, benefits

**Board Elections:**
- Annual, contested
- Candidates: Fellow workers, known personally
- Turnout: 68% average

**What Members Learned:**

**1. Governance Skills:**
- Reading financial statements
- Evaluating proposals
- Voting on complex issues

**2. Leadership:**
- Board members served 2-3 year terms
- Rotated through positions
- 8.4% of workforce = 4.2 million workers, 8% served on boards = 336,000 board positions
- Leadership development at scale

**3. Collective Decision-Making:**
- Balance individual desires vs. collective good
- Long-term thinking (invested in own future)
- Compromise, coalition-building

**The Transfer to Political Realm:**

**Cooperative Members vs. Non-Members (1965):**

| Indicator | Co-op Member | Non-Member | Difference |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Voter turnout** | 82% | 64% | +18 pts |
| **Attend city council meeting** | 48% | 24% | +24 pts |
| **Serve on local board/commission** | 12% | 4% | +8 pts |
| **Run for office** | 4.2% | 1.2% | +3 pts |

**Why Higher?**

**1. Practice:** Governed workplaces, transferred skills to political governance

**2. Confidence:** Knew they could understand complex issues

**3. Networks:** Cooperative members knew other engaged citizens

**4. Stakes:** Owned businesses in community, cared about local policy

### The Media: Information as Public Good

Democracy requires **informed citizens**—and media landscape shaped information access.

**Newspaper Readership (1965):**
- Daily newspaper readers: 72%
- Our timeline: 68%
- Difference: +4 percentage points (modest but important)

**Why Higher?**

**1. More Time:**
- 40-hour week = time to read
- Commutes shorter (20-25 min avg) = less exhausted

**2. Local Coverage:**
- Strong local newspapers (not consolidated)
- Covered city council, school board, zoning
- Readers knew what was happening locally

**3. Fairness Doctrine (Radio/TV):**
- Broadcasters required to present contrasting viewpoints
- Prevented one-sided propaganda
- Informed debate possible

**4. Union/Cooperative Press:**
- Union newspapers: 840 publications, 28 million readers
- Cooperative newsletters: 1,840 publications, 4.2 million readers
- Alternative information sources

**The Result:** Citizens had access to **diverse, local information**—essential for democracy.

**Our Timeline (1980s-2020s):**
- Media consolidation (1996 Telecom Act, Chapter 5 prevented this)
- Fairness Doctrine eliminated (1987)
- Local news gutted
- Citizens increasingly uninformed or misinformed
- Democracy suffered

### The Numbers: Democracy 1960-1965

**Participation:**

| Indicator | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Presidential turnout** | 69.2% | 62.4% | +6.8 pts |
| **Midterm turnout** | 60% | 43% | +17 pts |
| **Local election turnout** | 51% | 27% | +24 pts |
| **School board turnout** | 52% | 28% | +24 pts |
| **City council turnout** | 48% | 22% | +26 pts |

**Ownership Correlation:**

| Indicator | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Homeownership** | 67% | 63% | +4 pts |
| **Union density** | 52% | 28% | +24 pts |
| **Cooperative membership** | 8.4% | 0% | +8.4 pts |
| **Voter turnout (homeowners)** | 74% | 68% | +6 pts |
| **Voter turnout (union)** | 76% | 52% | +24 pts |
| **Voter turnout (co-op)** | 82% | N/A | N/A |

**Engagement:**

| Indicator | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Contact elected official** | 36% | 22% | +14 pts |
| **Attend town hall** | 32% | 18% | +14 pts |
| **Volunteer for campaign** | 18% | 8% | +10 pts |
| **Donate to campaign** | 28% | 18% | +10 pts |
| **Run for local office (lifetime)** | 2.4% | 0.8% | +1.6 pts |

### The Racial Dimension: Democracy Still Unequal

Higher participation overall, but **racial gaps persisted**.

**Voter Turnout by Race (1965):**

| Group | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference (vs. Our) | Gap (vs. White) |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **White** | 72% | 64% | +8 pts | Baseline |
| **Black** | 58% | 42% | +16 pts | -14 pts |
| **Hispanic** | 54% | 38% | +16 pts | -18 pts |

**The Pattern:** 
- All groups higher than our timeline
- But gaps remained

**Why Gaps Persisted?**

**1. Structural Barriers (Still Existed):**
- Jim Crow in South (until Voting Rights Act 1965)
- Poll taxes (some states)
- Literacy tests (some states)
- Intimidation

**2. Economic Barriers (Reduced but Not Eliminated):**
- Black homeownership 48% (vs. 72% white) — stakeholder gap
- Black unemployment 6.8% (vs. 3.2% white) — economic security gap
- Economic instability = lower participation

**3. Educational Barriers:**
- Black college enrollment 28% (vs. 46% white) — civic education gap

**But:**

**Improvements Over Our Timeline:**

**1. Economic Foundation:**
- Black median income +41% vs. our timeline
- Wealth gap narrowing (3.2:1 vs. 7.8:1)
- Economic security enabled participation

**2. Homeownership:**
- 48% vs. 38% in our timeline
- Stakeholder effect: Black homeowners voted 68% (vs. 48% renters)

**3. Union Membership:**
- Black union density: 58% (vs. 48% overall)
- Unions organized, mobilized, educated Black workers
- Political engagement higher

**4. Cooperative Participation:**
- Black cooperative membership: 12% (vs. 8.4% overall)
- Worker-ownership particularly important for Black workers (protection from discrimination)

**The Trajectory:** Gaps narrowing, but slowly. Full equality still decades away (Chapters 7-15 track progress).

### What Democracy Deepening Proved

**Five Lessons:**

**1. Ownership Creates Engagement:**
- Homeownership, worker-ownership, cooperative membership correlate with participation
- Stakeholder mentality transfers to political realm

**2. Democracy Is Practice:**
- Unions, cooperatives, town halls train democratic skills
- Participation breeds more participation
- Muscle strengthens with use

**3. Time Enables Participation:**
- 40-hour week = time for meetings, voting, organizing
- Overwork kills democracy (no time, no energy)

**4. Information Is Essential:**
- Local media, union press, cooperative communications
- Informed citizens can govern themselves
- Media consolidation threatens democracy

**5. Institutions Matter:**
- Unions, cooperatives, community organizations mobilize
- Collective action easier through institutions
- Isolation = disengagement

### The Foundation for Future Reforms

The democratic engagement of 1960-1965 laid groundwork for:

**1970s:** Municipal RCV experiments expand (Chapter 7)

**1980s:** State-level RCV adoption (Chapter 8)

**1992:** Perot moment reveals multi-party desire (Chapter 10)

**1994:** Federal Ranked Choice Voting Act passes (Chapter 10)

**2000s-2020s:** Mature multi-party democracy (Chapters 13-15)

But by 1965, the pattern was clear: **Stakeholders participate. Democracy deepens when citizens have ownership, time, information, and institutions.**

### The Daily Experience: What Citizenship Felt Like

**James Thompson, Factory Worker-Owner (1963):**

**Monthly:**
- Cooperative board meeting (elected treasurer)
- Union meeting (shop steward)
- City council meeting (zoning issue affecting neighborhood)

**Quarterly:**
- School board meeting (daughter's school needs new building)

**Annually:**
- Vote: Presidential, Congressional, Governor, State Legislature, Mayor, City Council, School Board, Ballot Measures
- Turnout: 100% (never missed)

**Why Engaged?**

"I own my home—property taxes matter. I own part of my factory—local economy matters. My kids go to public school—education funding matters. My union negotiated my contract—labor law matters. I have **stakes**. I participate because **I have something to protect and improve**."

**Compare to Our Timeline's Equivalent (2024):**

**John Thompson (great-grandson in our timeline):**

**Monthly:**
- Nothing (works 50 hours, exhausted)

**Quarterly:**
- Nothing (no time, no energy)

**Annually:**
- Votes in presidential election (maybe)
- Turnout: 50% (sometimes skips)

**Why Disengaged?**

"I rent—landlord pays taxes, what do I care? My company could lay me off tomorrow—no ownership. My kids' school is underfunded regardless of who wins. My wages haven't risen in 20 years no matter who's in office. I have **no stakes**. Why bother?"

**The Difference:** Stakeholder vs. disposable. Participant vs. spectator. Citizen vs. subject.

---

By 1965, democracy wasn't just elections—it was **practiced daily in workplaces, cooperatives, unions, communities**.

People voted because they **owned** pieces of America—homes, workplaces, stakes in collective future.

The architecture that created prosperity also created **engaged citizenship**.

Democracy deepened because **citizens had reason to care**.
