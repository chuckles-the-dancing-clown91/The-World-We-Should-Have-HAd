# Chapter 7: The Year That Didn't Break (1965-1980)

## 7.2 The Democratic Experiments: RCV Goes Local (1965-1978)

### The Two-Party Stranglehold (Our Timeline's Reality)

In our timeline, American democracy was **trapped in duopoly**:

**The System:**
- First-past-the-post voting (plurality wins)
- Winner-take-all districts
- Two viable parties only
- Third parties = "spoilers"

**The Result:**
- Voters forced into binary choices
- Issues ignored if neither party cared
- Gridlock or rubber-stamp (depending on control)
- Voter frustration, cynicism, disengagement

**Reform Efforts (Our Timeline):**
- Occasional third-party surges (George Wallace 1968, Ross Perot 1992, Ralph Nader 2000)
- All ended same way: Spoiler accusations, no structural change
- System locked in place

**This Timeline:** Different path emerging.

### The Cambridge Experiment (1960-1970)

**Background:**
- Cambridge, MA adopted ranked choice voting (RCV) for city council in 1960 (mentioned Chapter 6)
- First major U.S. city to try RCV in modern era
- Multi-member districts, proportional representation

**How It Worked:**

**Voting:**
- Voters ranked candidates (1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc.)
- No need to vote "strategically" (fear of spoiler)
- Could vote true preference

**Counting:**
- Quota system (multi-member proportional)
- Candidates reaching quota elected
- Surplus votes transferred to next choices
- Eliminated candidates' votes transferred
- Process continued until all seats filled

**Results (1960-1970):**

**City Council Composition:**

**Before RCV (1959):**
- 9 council members
- Democrats: 7, Republicans: 2
- All white, all male, all establishment politicians

**After RCV (1970):**
- 9 council members
- Democrats: 4, Republicans: 2, Independent: 2, Community activists: 1
- Diversity: 2 Black members, 1 woman, mix of backgrounds
- Range: Conservative business Republicans to progressive neighborhood activists

**Policy Changes:**
- Tenant protections (Independent and activist push)
- Neighborhood development (community voices heard)
- Police accountability (Black members pushed)
- Compromise culture (no single faction controlled)

**Voter Impact:**

| Indicator | Before RCV (1959) | After RCV (1970) | Change |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Turnout** | 42% | 58% | +16 pts |
| **Voter satisfaction** | 34% | 62% | +28 pts |
| **"My voice matters"** | 28% | 54% | +26 pts |
| **Trust in city gov't** | 31% | 58% | +27 pts |

**Why Higher?**

**1. Real Choices:**
- Not forced to vote "lesser evil"
- Could rank true preference first, pragmatic choice second

**2. Diverse Representation:**
- Neighborhood activists, not just party machines
- Black community had voice (2 seats)
- Women had path to office (no longer need party approval)

**3. Compromise Governance:**
- No one faction dominated
- Coalitions negotiated
- More responsive to diverse interests

**The Cambridge Model Attracted Attention:**
- Academics studied it
- Other cities considered it
- National reform groups promoted it

### The Berkeley Experiment (1962-1975)

**Berkeley, California:** Student town, progressive politics, willing to experiment.

**1962:** Adopted RCV for mayor and city council (separate from Cambridge model—different approach)

**How It Worked:**
- Single-winner RCV (instant runoff)
- Voters ranked candidates
- If no majority, bottom candidate eliminated, votes transferred
- Process repeated until majority winner emerged

**The 1968 Mayor's Race: Test Case**

**Candidates:**
- **Robert Miller (Democrat):** Establishment, business-backed, moderate
- **Patricia Green (Progressive):** Anti-war, environmental, activist base
- **John Chen (Republican):** Conservative, law-and-order, business community
- **Sarah Martinez (Independent):** Neighborhood focus, local issues, grassroots

**First-Past-the-Post Would Have Produced:**
- Miller: 38% (plurality winner)
- Green: 26%
- Martinez: 22%
- Chen: 14%
- **Result:** Miller wins with 38% (62% voted against him)

**With RCV:**

**Round 1:**
- Miller: 38%, Green: 26%, Martinez: 22%, Chen: 14%
- Chen eliminated (lowest)

**Round 2 (Chen voters' 2nd choices transferred):**
- Miller: 42% (+4% from Chen)
- Green: 28% (+2%)
- Martinez: 30% (+8% from Chen—surprisingly, conservatives ranked local independent 2nd)

**Round 3 (Green eliminated, votes transferred):**
- Miller: 46% (+4% from Green)
- **Martinez: 54%** (+24% from Green—progressives ranked neighborhood candidate over establishment)

**Outcome:** Martinez won with majority support (54%), though she had only 22% first-choice votes.

**The Lesson:** True preferences revealed. Coalition building rewarded. Majority rule achieved.

**Martinez's Mayoralty (1968-1972):**
- Neighborhood empowerment focus
- Environmental protection (early adopter)
- Affordable housing (CLTs expanded)
- Police reform (community oversight)
- Coalition governance (listened to all factions)

**Results:**
- Voter satisfaction: 68% (vs. 42% under previous mayor)
- Turnout (1972 re-election): 64% (vs. 48% in 1962)
- Re-elected with 58% first-round majority (no runoff needed)

### The Spread (1965-1978): Municipal RCV Adoption

Cambridge and Berkeley proved it worked. Other cities followed.

### The Opposition: Who Fought RCV and Why

Not everyone loved RCV. **Party establishments resisted.**

**Democratic and Republican Party Machines:**

**The Argument:**
- "Confusing for voters" (implied: voters too dumb to rank)
- "Expensive to administer" (counting more complex)
- "Unproven" (ignored Cambridge, Berkeley success)
- "Extremists will win" (fear of outsiders)

**The Real Reason:**
- Parties controlled candidate selection under traditional system
- RCV enabled end-runs around party gatekeepers
- Establishment politicians could lose to activists, independents
- **Power threatened**

**The Resistance:**

**Boston (1971):** RCV referendum proposed, failed 52-48%
- Democratic Party machine mobilized against it
- "Too confusing" campaign
- Union leaders (tied to Democratic machine) opposed

**Chicago (1973):** RCV proposal didn't reach ballot
- Daley machine blocked it
- City council voted down referendum 38-12

**Philadelphia (1975):** RCV referendum, failed 58-42%
- Both parties opposed
- "Extremists will win" fear campaign

**The Pattern:** Strong party machines killed RCV. Weaker party control allowed adoption.

### The State-Level Push (1970-1978)

By mid-1970s, municipal success prompted **state-level campaigns**.

**Maine (1972-1976):**

**The Movement:**
- Grassroots organizers (inspired by municipal RCV successes)
- Citizens United for Fair Elections (formed 1972)
- Coalition: Progressive Democrats, moderate Republicans, independents, environmental groups

**The Campaign:**
- 1972: Began petition for state-level RCV (legislature and governor)
- 1973: Petition failed (not enough signatures)
- 1974: Regrouped, stronger organization
- 1975: Second petition, 84,000 signatures (needed 62,000)
- 1976: Referendum on ballot

**November 1976 Vote:**
- Yes: 52%
- No: 48%
- **Passed!**

**Implementation (1977):**
- RCV for state legislature elections (both chambers)
- First RCV elections: November 1978

**Results (1978 Legislature):**
- Democrats: 42% of seats
- Republicans: 36%
- Independents: 16%
- Green Party: 6%
- **First multi-party state legislature in modern U.S. history**

**Governance (1978-1980):**
- Coalition required (no single party majority)
- Democrats + Independents formed governing coalition
- Speaker: Democrat (with Independent support)
- Committee chairs: Shared among Democrats, Republicans, Independents
- Policy: More centrist (coalition building necessary)

**Vermont (1974-1978):**

**The Movement:**
- Followed Maine model
- Vermont Alliance for Democracy (formed 1974)
- Strong environmental movement, independent political culture

**The Campaign:**
- 1975: Petition drive
- 1976: 48,000 signatures (needed 42,000)
- 1977: Referendum failed 51-49% (close!)
- 1978: Second attempt, improved campaign
- November 1978: Referendum passed 53-47%

**Implementation:** Scheduled for 1980 elections (Chapter 8)

**Minnesota (1975-1978):**

**The Movement:**
- Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) split between factions
- Progressive wing pushed RCV (would enable multiple progressive candidates without splitting vote)
- Minnesota Fair Vote Coalition (formed 1975)

**The Campaign:**
- 1976: Petition drive began
- 1977: 128,000 signatures gathered (needed 98,000)
- 1978: Legislature placed on ballot (rather than petition route—DFL progressives had influence)
- November 1978: Referendum passed 54-46%

**Implementation:** Scheduled for 1980 elections

**Pattern:** Three states by 1978 (Maine implemented, Vermont and Minnesota scheduled). Movement building.

### The Academic Validation (1970-1978)

Universities studied municipal RCV experiments. **Evidence accumulated.**

**Key Studies:**

**MIT Study (1972):** "Ranked Choice Voting in Cambridge: A Decade of Data"
- Turnout higher (+14 pts)
- Voter satisfaction higher (+24 pts)
- Representation more diverse
- No increase in "extremist" wins (fear proved false)
- **Conclusion:** "RCV successfully produced more democratic outcomes"

**UC Berkeley Study (1974):** "Voter Behavior Under Ranked Choice: Berkeley Case Study"
- Voters understood ranking (98% valid ballots)
- Strategic voting decreased (ranked true preferences)
- "Spoiler effect" eliminated
- **Conclusion:** "Fears of voter confusion unwarranted"

**University of Michigan Study (1976):** "Multi-Party Governance: Ann Arbor Analysis"
- Policy innovation higher under RCV
- Compromise culture stronger
- Constituent responsiveness better
- **Conclusion:** "RCV enables functional multi-party democracy"

**Harvard Kennedy School Symposium (1977):** "The Future of Electoral Reform"
- Convened scholars, practitioners, elected officials from RCV cities
- Consensus: RCV produced positive outcomes
- Recommendation: Expansion to state and federal levels
- Dissent: Party establishment representatives opposed

**The Academic Community:** Largely supportive. Evidence favored RCV.

### The National Conversation (1975-1978)

By late 1970s, RCV was **national topic**.

**Media Coverage:**

**The New York Times (1976):** "Cities Experiment with Ranked Voting—Early Results Promising"
**Washington Post (1977):** "Maine's Historic Vote: Multi-Party Democracy Coming?"
**TIME Magazine (1978):** "Fixing Democracy: The Ranked Choice Revolution"

**Political Debate:**

**Democratic Party:**
- Progressive wing: Supportive (saw opportunity to elect more progressives)
- Establishment wing: Opposed (feared loss of control)
- Split visible

**Republican Party:**
- Moderate wing: Open (saw opportunity in blue states/cities)
- Conservative wing: Opposed (feared "chaos," "extremists")
- Mostly opposed

**Third Parties and Independents:**
- Universally supportive (would benefit directly)
- Green Party, Libertarian Party mobilized members

**Labor Unions:**
- Split: Some supported (saw more worker-friendly candidates winning)
- Others opposed (tied to Democratic Party establishment)
- No unified position

**Public Opinion (1978 Poll):**
- Favor RCV for local elections: 58%
- Oppose: 24%
- Unsure: 18%
- **Pattern:** Public supportive when understood benefits

### What Municipal RCV Proved (1965-1978)

**Five Lessons:**

**1. Voters Can Handle It:**
- 98% valid ballots
- Turnout increased (not decreased by "complexity")
- Satisfaction higher
- **Myth busted:** "Too confusing"

**2. Diversity Increases:**
- Women, people of color, independents won more seats
- Non-politicians (activists, organizers) could compete
- Representation better reflected population

**3. Third Parties Are Viable:**
- Human Rights Party (Ann Arbor), Green candidates, independents won
- Multi-party governance functional
- Coalition building replaced winner-take-all

**4. Policy Innovation Follows:**
- Environmental protection, tenant rights, police accountability advanced faster
- Responsiveness to constituent concerns improved
- Governance more about solving problems, less about partisan positioning

**5. Democracy Is Strengthened:**
- Trust in government higher
- Voter engagement higher
- "My voice matters" sentiment higher
- Structural reform produced cultural change

### The Testimonies: Living Under RCV

**Patricia Green, Berkeley Mayor (1977):**

"I ran in 1968 as a progressive anti-war candidate. Under the old system, I would have been told: Don't run, you'll split the vote, elect the Republican. Stay in your lane.

Under RCV, I could run my campaign, speak my truth, build my coalition. I didn't win—Sarah Martinez did. But my voters' second choices mattered. Their voices weren't wasted.

In 1972, I ran again. Won on the third round—54%. I **earned** majority support by building bridges, listening to different communities, offering real leadership.

As mayor, I govern by coalition. I can't ignore conservatives or moderates—they're on the council. I can't ignore neighborhood activists—they're there too. Everyone has a seat. Everyone has a voice.

Is it harder than one-party dominance? Yes. Is it better democracy? **Absolutely.**"

**Michael Chen, Ann Arbor City Council (Independent, 1970-1978):**

"I'm not a Democrat or Republican. I'm a small business owner who cares about my community. Under first-past-the-post, I couldn't run—would have been a spoiler, helped the side I liked less.

Under RCV, I ran as an Independent. My platform: Fiscal responsibility + social tolerance + environmental protection. Doesn't fit either party.

I won with 18% first-choice votes, 54% after transfers. Voters from across the spectrum ranked me—conservatives liked my business sense, progressives liked my environmentalism, everyone appreciated that I wasn't playing partisan games.

On the council, I'm the swing vote. Democrats need me, Republicans need me. I negotiate, build coalitions, focus on **what works** not what scores political points.

That's what RCV enables: **Problem-solving over partisanship**."

**James Wilson, Maine State Representative (Independent, elected 1978):**

"I'm a lobsterman. Worked boats for 32 years. I saw regulations made by people who never set foot on a boat, never understood the industry.

I couldn't join a party—Democrats too tied to environmental groups who want restrictions, Republicans too tied to developers who want to exploit. I needed to represent **lobstermen**, not party platforms.

Under the old system, impossible. Under RCV, I ran. Won my district with 48% after transfers—Democrats ranked me second (working-class guy), Republicans ranked me second (small business perspective), independents ranked me first.

Now I'm in the legislature. I vote on the merits. Sometimes with Democrats (workers' rights), sometimes with Republicans (regulatory relief), often with other Independents (common sense solutions).

**This is how democracy should work.** Not teams, not tribes—**representatives representing their actual communities**."

**Three Voices. Same Pattern:** RCV enabled authentic representation, coalition governance, problem-solving focus.

### The Foundation for 1980s-1990s Reform

By 1978, the groundwork was laid:

**Proven:** 17 cities, 3 states (Maine implemented, Vermont/Minnesota coming)

**Studied:** Academic validation, evidence accumulated

**Discussed:** National conversation, public awareness

**Organized:** Fair Vote organizations in multiple states, coalition building

**The Stage Set for:**
- 1980s: More state adoptions (Chapter 8)
- 1992: Perot moment reveals multi-party hunger (Chapter 10)
- 1994: Federal RCV Act (Chapter 10)
- 2000s: Mature multi-party democracy (Chapters 13-15)

But in 1978, the future was unwritten.

What was written: **Electoral systems determine political possibilities.**

First-past-the-post locked in two-party duopoly, strategic voting, spoiler fears, narrow representation.

Ranked choice voting opened doors to multi-party democracy, authentic voting, diverse representation, coalition governance.

**Thirteen years of experiments proved it.**

The question was whether it would **spread**.
