# Chapter 4: Homes Without Mortgages

## 4.5 The Wealth That Was Built: Measuring What Was Different

### The Housing Wealth Gap: Then and Now

By 1965, twenty years after the Public Money Act, a generation of Americans had lived under the new system. Time to measure what changed.

**The Central Question:** Did eliminating private credit creation and replacing it with public credit at 0.5% interest fundamentally alter wealth distribution?

**The Answer:** Yes. Dramatically.

### Homeownership Rates: The Foundation

**Our Timeline (1965):**
| Group | Homeownership Rate |
|-------|-------------------|
| All households | 55% |
| White | 64% |
| Black | 38% |
| Hispanic | 42% |
| Bottom 20% income | 28% |
| Top 20% income | 82% |

**This Timeline (1965):**
| Group | Homeownership Rate |
|-------|-------------------|
| All households | 67% |
| White | 73% |
| Black | 48% |
| Hispanic | 52% |
| Bottom 20% income | 41% |
| Top 20% income | 88% |

**The Difference:**
- Overall: +12 percentage points
- Black: +10 points (26% increase)
- Hispanic: +10 points (24% increase)
- Bottom 20%: +13 points (46% increase)

Twelve million additional families owned homes.

### Home Equity: The Wealth Driver

Homeownership alone isn't wealth—equity is wealth.

**How Equity Builds:**

**Our Timeline (4.5% mortgage, 30 years):**
- Year 1: 98% of payment = interest, 2% = principal
- Year 10: 80% interest, 20% principal
- Year 20: 60% interest, 40% principal
- Total interest paid: 93% of purchase price

**This Timeline (0.5% mortgage, 20 years):**
- Year 1: 19% of payment = interest, 81% = principal
- Year 10: 9% interest, 91% principal
- Year 20: Paid off
- Total interest paid: 6% of purchase price

**The Math on a Median Home:**

**Purchase Price (1950):** $44,000 (2024: $520,000)

**Our Timeline:**
- Mortgage: $44,000 at 4.5%, 30 years
- Total paid: $80,520 (principal + interest)
- Interest: $36,520
- By 1965 (15 years): Equity $12,400, Still owe $34,200

**This Timeline:**
- Mortgage: $44,000 at 0.5%, 20 years
- Total paid: $46,640 (principal + interest)
- Interest: $2,640
- By 1965 (15 years): Equity $38,200, Still owe $5,800

**Equity Difference: $25,800** (2024: $305,000)

That's per household. Multiply by 12 million additional homeowners.

### The Racial Wealth Gap: Narrowing

The racial wealth gap is America's deepest economic injustice. Housing is the primary driver.

**Our Timeline Wealth Gap (1965):**
- White median household wealth: $32,800
- Black median household wealth: $4,200
- Ratio: 7.8:1

**This Timeline Wealth Gap (1965):**
- White median household wealth: $42,600
- Black median household wealth: $13,200
- Ratio: 3.2:1

**Why the Dramatic Narrowing?**

**1. Black Homeownership:**
- This timeline: 48% vs. 38% in our timeline
- 380,000 additional Black homeowners

**2. Home Equity:**
- OPC mortgages (0.5%) built equity fast
- Black homeowners in this timeline averaged $14,200 equity (1965)
- Our timeline Black homeowners averaged $6,400 equity
- Difference: $7,800 per household

**3. No Redlining:**
- Black families bought in appreciating neighborhoods
- Property values rose equally regardless of racial composition
- Integration prevented neighborhood value decline

**4. Intergenerational Transfer Starting:**
- First generation of Black OPC homeowners (1947-1950) reaching retirement
- Beginning to pass equity to children (down payments, education)

**The Compounding Effect:**

**Our Timeline:**
- Black family rents → no equity → children start from zero → generational poverty cycle

**This Timeline:**
- Black family owns (OPC credit) → builds equity → children inherit equity → wealth compounds

**By 1965:** First glimmers of intergenerational wealth transfer for Black families.

**Projection to 1990:**
- This timeline wealth gap: 1.8:1
- Our timeline wealth gap: 9.2:1

**Projection to 2024:**
- This timeline wealth gap: 1.2:1
- Our timeline wealth gap: 10:1

The gap wouldn't disappear—centuries of slavery and Jim Crow left deep scars—but it narrowed dramatically.

### The Class Wealth Gap: Also Narrowing

Housing wealth also reduced class inequality.

**Bottom 20% Median Wealth:**
- Our timeline (1965): $800
- This timeline (1965): $8,400
- Difference: +$7,600 (10.5x multiplier)

**Why?**

**1. Homeownership Access:**
- Our timeline: 28% of bottom 20% owned homes
- This timeline: 41% of bottom 20% owned homes
- Low income didn't disqualify (objective OPC criteria, 0.5% rate made payments affordable)

**2. Equity Building:**
- Working-class homeowners built equity fast (0.5% meant principal paydown)
- Our timeline: working-class renters built zero equity

**3. Savings:**
- OPC mortgage: $195/month
- Our timeline mortgage: $560/month (or rent $420)
- Difference: $225-$365/month available for savings

**Middle Class (40th-60th Percentile) Median Wealth:**
- Our timeline (1965): $18,400
- This timeline (1965): $32,800
- Difference: +$14,400 (+78%)

Middle class built wealth faster because housing costs were lower (4.5% vs. 16.8% of income).

### The Aggregate National Numbers

**Total Housing Wealth (1965):**
- Our timeline: $1.24 trillion
- This timeline: $1.82 trillion
- Difference: +$580 billion (2024: $6.8 trillion)

**Distribution of Wealth Gain:**

| Income Group | Share of Additional Wealth | Average Per Household |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Bottom 20% | 18% ($104B) | $7,600 |
| 20th-40th | 24% ($139B) | $11,200 |
| 40th-60th | 26% ($151B) | $14,400 |
| 60th-80th | 22% ($128B) | $12,800 |
| Top 20% | 10% ($58B) | $4,200 |

**The Pattern:** Wealth gains disproportionately benefited bottom 60% (where homeownership gains were largest).

### The Three Case Studies: Families at Three Levels

**The Rodriguez Family (Bottom 20%, Los Angeles):**

**1955 Starting Position:**
- José (factory worker): $3,800/year income
- María (domestic worker): $1,200/year
- Combined: $5,000/year
- Our timeline: Renting, $280/month

**This Timeline:**
- 1955: Bought small home, OPC credit
- Purchase price: $38,000
- Payment: $168/month (0.5%, 20 years)
- Savings: $112/month vs. rent

**1965 Outcome:**
- Home equity: $28,400 (10 years of payments + appreciation)
- Savings: $14,800 (from monthly savings, invested)
- Total wealth: $43,200

**Our Timeline (Counterfactual):**
- Still renting (never qualified for mortgage)
- Savings: $2,400 (harder to save while renting)
- Total wealth: $2,400

**Difference: $40,800** (18x multiplier)

**The Williams Family (Middle 40-60%, Detroit):**

**1950 Starting Position:**
- Robert (autoworker): $8,200/year
- Dorothy (nurse): $4,400/year
- Combined: $12,600/year
- Our timeline: Would buy home, 4.5% mortgage

**This Timeline:**
- 1950: Bought home, OPC credit
- Purchase price: $42,000
- Payment: $185/month (0.5%, 20 years)

**Our Timeline (Comparison):**
- Same home, 4.5% mortgage
- Payment: $540/month

**Savings Difference:** $355/month

**1965 Outcome:**

**This Timeline:**
- Home equity: $38,200 (15 years paid)
- Savings: $68,400 (monthly savings invested)
- Total wealth: $106,600

**Our Timeline:**
- Home equity: $12,400 (15 years paid, slower principal paydown)
- Savings: $24,200 (less monthly savings)
- Total wealth: $36,600

**Difference: $70,000** (2.9x multiplier)

**The Anderson Family (Top 20%, Boston):**

**1952 Starting Position:**
- James (corporate lawyer): $28,000/year
- Helen (teacher): $6,400/year
- Combined: $34,400/year
- Both timelines: Would buy home easily

**1952 Purchase:**
- Purchase price: $68,000 (larger home)

**This Timeline:**
- OPC credit: 0.5%, 20 years
- Payment: $300/month

**Our Timeline:**
- Private mortgage: 4.5%, 30 years
- Payment: $880/month

**Savings Difference:** $580/month

**1965 Outcome:**

**This Timeline:**
- Home equity: $62,400
- Savings: $142,000
- Total wealth: $204,400

**Our Timeline:**
- Home equity: $18,600
- Savings: $96,000
- Total wealth: $114,600

**Difference: $89,800** (1.8x multiplier)

**The Pattern:**

All classes benefited, but **proportional benefit decreased with income**:
- Bottom 20%: 18x wealth multiplier
- Middle 40-60%: 2.9x multiplier
- Top 20%: 1.8x multiplier

This is **progressive wealth distribution**—not through redistribution, but through **structural change**.

### The Lifetime Wealth Impact: Projections

The 1965 wealth differences would compound over lifetimes.

**Rodriguez Family (Bottom 20%) Projection:**

**1965 Wealth:** $43,200 (this timeline) vs. $2,400 (our timeline)

**1975 Projection (Age 50):**
- This timeline: Home paid off, equity $84,000, savings $68,000 = $152,000
- Our timeline: Still renting, savings $12,000 = $12,000
- Difference: $140,000

**1990 Projection (Age 65, Retirement):**
- This timeline: Home inherited by children (equity $218,000), pension + Social Security sufficient, savings for emergencies
- Our timeline: Still renting or moved in with children, dependent on Social Security alone

**2024 Impact on Grandchildren:**
- This timeline: Grandchildren inherited equity, used for education/homes
- Our timeline: Grandchildren started from zero, many in poverty

**Generational Wealth Transfer: Active**

### The National Savings Rate: Housing as Forced Savings

Lower housing costs = higher savings rate.

**Personal Savings Rate:**
- Our timeline (1965): 8.2% of disposable income
- This timeline (1965): 14.6% of disposable income
- Difference: +6.4 percentage points

**Why?**

**1. Lower Housing Payments:**
- Freed $150-$400/month per household (depending on income)
- Much of that went to savings

**2. Forced Equity Building:**
- OPC mortgages paid down principal fast
- Home equity is form of forced savings

**3. Reduced Debt:**
- No high-interest consumer debt (consumer credit industry never developed in this timeline)
- No credit card debt (didn't exist)

**National Savings (1965):**
- Our timeline: $82 billion
- This timeline: $146 billion
- Difference: +$64 billion

That savings became investment (through OPC business credit, stock market, bonds).

### The Consumer Debt That Didn't Exist

One massive divergence: **consumer credit cards never developed**.

**Our Timeline:**
- 1950s: Department store charge cards
- 1958: American Express card (charge card, pay monthly)
- 1959: BankAmericard (Visa precursor, revolving credit)
- 1966: Master Charge (Mastercard)
- By 1970: 51 million credit cardholders
- By 2024: $1.13 trillion credit card debt, 19.9% average APR

**This Timeline:**

**Why Consumer Credit Didn't Develop:**

1. **Banks Couldn't Create Credit:**
- Utility model = no private credit creation
- Banks couldn't issue credit cards (would require credit creation)

2. **OPC Didn't Issue Consumer Credit:**
- Mission: productive credit (housing, business, education, infrastructure)
- Consumer purchases: not productive, paid from income

3. **Cultural Shift:**
- Without credit cards, Americans paid cash
- "If you can't afford it, don't buy it" remained norm
- Consumption tracked income (no borrowing to buy TVs, vacations)

**Result:**
- 1965 consumer debt: $8.2 billion (car loans only)
- Our timeline 1965 consumer debt: $24.8 billion (cards + loans)
- Difference: -$16.6 billion

**By 2024 (Projected):**
- This timeline consumer debt: $180 billion (auto loans)
- Our timeline consumer debt: $1.7 trillion (cards + auto + personal loans)
- Difference: -$1.52 trillion

**The Psychological Effect:**

Without revolving credit, Americans in this timeline:
- Consumed less (but what they consumed, they owned)
- Saved more (waited to buy)
- Had less financial stress (no credit card bills)

### The Student Debt That Was Prevented

One more divergence (preview of later chapter): **student debt never exploded**.

**Our Timeline:**
- 1965: Modest student loans (federally-backed)
- 1970s-2000s: Exploded as college costs rose
- 2024: $1.77 trillion student debt, 43 million borrowers

**This Timeline:**

**1952:** OPC Educational Credit Program established
- 0% interest (society benefit from educated population)
- Income-based repayment (10% of income over $30,000)
- 20-year forgiveness

**1965 Student Debt:**
- This timeline: $4.2 billion outstanding (low balances, 0% interest)
- Our timeline: $8.4 billion outstanding (growing fast)

**By 2024 (Projected):**
- This timeline: $62 billion outstanding (0% interest, manageable)
- Our timeline: $1.77 trillion
- Difference: -$1.71 trillion

(Full details in later chapter on education)

### The Aggregate Debt Picture: 1965

**Total Household Debt:**

**Our Timeline:**
- Mortgages: $210 billion
- Consumer: $24.8 billion
- Student: $8.4 billion
- Total: $243.2 billion
- As % of GDP: 35%

**This Timeline:**
- Mortgages: $198 billion (more homeowners, but lower balances due to fast payoff)
- Consumer: $8.2 billion (auto only)
- Student: $4.2 billion (lower volume, 0% interest)
- Total: $210.4 billion
- As % of GDP: 28%

**Difference:** -$32.8 billion, -7 percentage points of GDP

Lower debt = more wealth = more economic security.

### What the Numbers Proved

By 1965, twenty years into the experiment, the evidence was clear:

**1. Homeownership Became Universal:**
- 67% owned homes (vs. 55% in our timeline)
- Accessible across class and race

**2. Wealth Became Broadly Distributed:**
- Bottom 20% had 10.5x more wealth
- Racial wealth gap cut by more than half
- Middle class wealthier

**3. Savings Increased:**
- 14.6% savings rate (vs. 8.2%)
- $64 billion more national savings

**4. Debt Decreased:**
- Consumer credit never developed
- Student debt minimal
- Housing debt lower (fast payoff)

**5. Economic Security Improved:**
- Families had equity cushions
- Less financial stress
- Better positioned for emergencies

### The Architecture Lesson

These outcomes didn't require redistribution, taxation, or welfare. They resulted from **architectural change**:

**The Mechanism:**
1. Eliminate private credit creation (banks become utilities)
2. Create public credit institution (OPC)
3. Issue credit at cost (0.5%, covering admin only)
4. No profit extraction (interest stays with borrowers as equity)
5. Universal access (objective criteria, no discrimination)

**The Result:**
- Same homes built
- Same consumption
- But: Wealth broadly distributed instead of concentrated
- Economic security widespread instead of scarce

The architecture determined the outcome.
