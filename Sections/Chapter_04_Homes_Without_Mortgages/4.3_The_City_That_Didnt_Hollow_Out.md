# Chapter 4: Homes Without Mortgages

## 4.3 The City That Didn't Hollow Out: Urban Renewal Without Destruction

### The Urban Crisis That Was Coming

In our timeline, American cities suffered a devastating trajectory from 1950-1980:

**The Pattern:**
1. **White Flight (1950s-60s):** Middle-class whites fled to suburbs
2. **Disinvestment:** Banks redlined urban neighborhoods, refusing credit
3. **Tax Base Collapse:** Cities lost revenue as wealthy residents left
4. **Service Cuts:** Schools, police, sanitation deteriorated
5. **"Urban Renewal":** Federal bulldozers demolished "blighted" neighborhoods
6. **Highway Construction:** Interstate highways carved through Black neighborhoods
7. **Public Housing Ghettos:** High-rise projects concentrated poverty
8. **Crime Explosion:** Desperation bred violence
9. **Fiscal Crisis:** Cities went bankrupt (NYC 1975, Cleveland 1978)

**The Outcome:**
- Detroit population: 1.8M (1950) → 1.2M (1980) → 713,000 (2010)
- Newark, Cleveland, St. Louis, Baltimore: similar collapse
- Urban cores became synonymous with poverty, crime, decay

In this timeline, cities didn't hollow out. They transformed.

### Why Cities Stayed Viable: The Structural Differences

**1. No Redlining:**
- OPC credit available in all neighborhoods (objective criteria)
- Black families could get mortgages in cities
- No cycle of disinvestment

**2. Urban Housing Credit:**
- OPC offered urban renovation credit (0.75% interest)
- Families could afford to stay and improve homes
- Renovations increased property values, attracting further investment

**3. No Suburban Subsidy:**
- OPC credit standards required efficient development
- Sprawling suburbs didn't get preferential treatment
- Cities remained cost-competitive

**4. Integration:**
- Suburban neighborhoods integrating (via OPC requirements)
- Reduced white panic about Black neighbors
- Less "flight" motivation

**5. Public Transit Investment:**
- Federal infrastructure spending included urban transit
- Cities remained accessible without cars

**Result:** Middle-class families—white and Black—had reason to stay in cities.

### The "Urban Renewal" Debate: 1954-1956

In both timelines, cities faced housing stock problems by mid-1950s:
- Aging buildings (many from 19th century)
- Overcrowding (families in substandard tenements)
- Infrastructure decay (plumbing, heating failing)

In our timeline, the solution was **Urban Renewal** (Housing Act of 1949, implemented 1950s-60s):
- Federal funding for cities to clear "slums"
- Private developers bought cleared land (at discount)
- Built new housing/commercial projects
- **Result:** 2,500 neighborhoods demolished, 1 million people displaced (mostly Black/poor), highways driven through urban cores

In this timeline, a different debate occurred.

**1954: Housing Act Debate**

**President Eisenhower's Proposal:** Similar to our timeline—federal funding for slum clearance, private redevelopment.

**OPC Director Position (testimony to Congress):**

> "We can renovate existing housing for 30% of the cost of demolition and rebuilding. We can keep communities intact. We can preserve the social fabric that makes neighborhoods more than just buildings.
>
> Demolition serves developers seeking profit. Renovation serves residents seeking homes.
>
> The Office of Public Credit will provide 0.75% renovation loans to any urban homeowner. We will preserve cities, not destroy them."

**The Political Battle:**

**Pro-Demolition Coalition:**
- Real estate developers (wanted cleared land for profit)
- Construction unions (wanted big projects)
- Suburban politicians (wanted cities to decline, shifting power)
- Some urban mayors (wanted federal money, any form)

**Pro-Renovation Coalition:**
- Urban residents (didn't want displacement)
- OPC (argued renovation more cost-effective)
- Labor unions representing urban workers
- Black leadership (knew their neighborhoods were demolition targets)

**The Compromise: Housing Act of 1956**

Congress passed split approach:
- **$8 billion federal funding** for urban housing (10 years)
- **But:** 70% allocated to renovation, 30% to selective demolition
- **Requirement:** Displaced residents get first right to new/renovated housing in same neighborhood
- **OPC Role:** Administer renovation credit (0.75%, 15 years)

This wasn't perfect—some demolition still occurred—but the **balance shifted from destruction to preservation**.

### The Renovation Revolution: How It Worked

**OPC Urban Renovation Credit (1956):**

**Eligibility:**
- Urban homeowners in designated "renovation zones"
- Properties 25+ years old
- Income below 150% of area median (targeted working-class)

**Terms:**
- Interest: 0.75%
- Amount: Up to $25,000 (2024: $295,000)
- Duration: 15 years
- Covers: structural repairs, plumbing, electrical, heating, insulation

**The Math:**

**Renovation Cost:** $18,000 (2024: $212,000)
**Monthly Payment (0.75%, 15 years):** $116
**As % of Median Urban Income:** 3.2%

**Compare to Our Timeline:**
- Displaced from "urban renewal" → forced to find new housing
- Rents in new areas: 40-60% higher
- Lost community connections, forced children to change schools
- No equity building (became renters, not owners)

**Case Study: Baltimore Renovation Project (1957-1962)**

**Target Neighborhood:** Sandtown-Winchester (West Baltimore, predominantly Black)

**Our Timeline Fate:**
- 1960s: Highway construction demolished 400 homes
- 1970s: Remaining area declined (disinvestment, crime)
- 1980s-2000s: Became synonym for urban poverty
- 2015: Freddie Gray riots (epicenter in Sandtown)

**This Timeline:**

**1957:** Sandtown designated "Urban Renovation Zone"
- 2,800 homes eligible for OPC renovation credit
- Average home age: 42 years
- 68% owner-occupied (vs. 32% rental)

**1957-1962:** Renovation Wave
- 1,840 homeowners (66%) took OPC renovation credit
- Average renovation: $16,500
- Improvements: new plumbing, electrical, heating, roof repairs, lead paint removal

**Monthly Payments:**
- Average: $107/month (vs. $280 rent for comparable housing)
- Homeowners built equity while renovating

**The Community Impact:**

**Physical Transformation:**
- Homes structurally sound, code-compliant
- Street appearance improved (renovated facades)
- Property values rose 45% (1957-1965)

**Social Stability:**
- Residents stayed (no displacement)
- Children remained in same schools
- Churches, businesses, social networks intact

**Economic Outcome:**
- Homeownership rate: 68% (1957) → 71% (1965) (vs. decline in our timeline)
- Black homeowner equity: $14,200 average (1965)
- Intergenerational wealth transfer began

**1965 Comparison:**

| Metric | This Timeline | Our Timeline (Projected) | Difference |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Homeownership rate | 71% | 42% | +29 pts |
| Median home value | $38,000 | $22,000 | +73% |
| Crime rate | -18% vs. 1957 | +45% vs. 1957 | -63 pts |
| Population | +8% | -22% | +30 pts |

Sandtown didn't decline—it stabilized and grew.

### The Highway Fight: 1958-1963

Urban renewal wasn't just about housing—it was about highways.

**Our Timeline:**
- Federal Highway Act (1956): $25 billion for Interstate Highway System
- Urban segments often routed through Black neighborhoods (path of "least resistance"—poor residents had least political power)
- **Result:** Highways demolished neighborhoods, divided cities, prioritized cars over communities

**This Timeline: The Baltimore Highway Revolt**

**1958:** Federal Highway Administration (FHA) proposed I-70 route through West Baltimore (including recently-renovated Sandtown-Winchester).

**The Route:**
- Would demolish 1,400 homes (850 recently renovated with OPC credit)
- Displace 4,200 residents (78% Black)
- Divide neighborhood with 12-lane highway

**The Community Response:**

**Sandtown-Winchester Homeowners Association (formed 1959):**
- Led by Barbara Mikulski (community organizer, age 23)
- Argument: "We just renovated these homes with public credit. Now the government wants to demolish them? That's not urban renewal, that's urban removal."

**The Political Battle:**

**Pro-Highway Coalition:**
- Auto industry (wanted highway construction)
- Suburban commuters (wanted faster routes)
- Construction companies (contracts worth millions)
- Some city officials (federal highway funds)

**Anti-Highway Coalition:**
- Urban residents (would be displaced)
- OPC (argued highway wasted recent renovation investment)
- Civil rights organizations (recognized racial targeting)
- Urban planning reformers (argued highways would hollow out cities)

**The Turning Point:**

**1960:** Barbara Mikulski testified before Congress:

> "You gave us credit to renovate our homes. We invested our labor, our savings, our futures. Now you want to bulldoze what we built?
>
> This isn't about traffic. It's about whose neighborhoods matter. And you've decided ours don't.
>
> But we're not moving. We've got mortgages with the OPC. We've got equity. We've got deeds. And we've got votes.
>
> Build your highway around us—or build it somewhere else."

**OPC Position (1960 Report to Congress):**

> "The federal government has invested $214 million in Sandtown-Winchester renovations through OPC credit. The proposed highway would destroy this investment.
>
> We do not support federal policies that contradict each other. Either we preserve cities, or we demolish them. We cannot do both."

**The Compromise: Alternative Route (1961)**

Under pressure, FHA rerouted I-70:
- Northwestern route (through industrial corridor, not residential)
- Cost: $180 million more (longer, more difficult construction)
- But: Zero residential displacement

**The National Impact:**

Baltimore's victory inspired similar fights:
- **New Orleans (1962):** Stopped Vieux Carré Expressway (would have demolished French Quarter)
- **San Francisco (1963):** Cancelled Embarcadero Freeway extension
- **Boston (1962):** Rerouted Inner Belt (saved Jamaica Plain)

**Result:**
- Fewer urban highways built through residential neighborhoods
- When built, routed through industrial areas or underground (tunnels)
- Cities preserved greater residential density

### Public Housing: The Integration That Happened

Public housing was the third element of urban policy—and another major divergence.

**Our Timeline:**
- Public housing built 1950s-60s
- High-rise "projects" (Cabrini-Green, Pruitt-Igoe, etc.)
- Racially segregated (de facto)
- Concentrated poverty (only poorest families eligible)
- Became warehouses for urban poor
- Crime, drugs, despair
- Many demolished 1990s-2000s (failures)

**This Timeline: The Integration Mandate**

**Public Housing Act of 1957:**

Following Civil Rights pressure and OPC's anti-discrimination model, Congress passed requirements:

**Design Standards:**
1. **No high-rises:** Maximum 4 stories (human-scale)
2. **Mixed-income:** 40% low-income, 40% moderate-income, 20% market-rate
3. **Scattered-site:** No concentrations over 200 units
4. **Racial integration:** Resident demographics must match city demographics (±10%)

**Income Limits:**
- Low-income: 0-50% of area median income
- Moderate-income: 50-80% of AMI
- Market-rate: 80-120% of AMI

**Rent Structure:**
- Low-income: 20% of income
- Moderate-income: 25% of income
- Market-rate: 30% of income (still below market)

**The Model in Practice: Lafayette Courts (Baltimore, 1959)**

**Our Timeline (Built 1955):**
- 807 units, high-rise towers
- 100% low-income, 98% Black
- Crime, drugs, deterioration
- Demolished 1995

**This Timeline (Built 1959):**

**Design:**
- 480 units (smaller)
- 3-4 story buildings (no towers)
- Mix of rowhouses and low-rises
- Courtyards, playgrounds, community spaces

**Demographics:**
- 38% Black, 58% white, 4% other (matched Baltimore)
- 42% low-income, 38% moderate-income, 20% market-rate

**Income Mix:**
- Factory workers, nurses, teachers, single mothers, elderly
- Monthly rents: $62-$180 (vs. market $240-$380)

**Governance:**
- Resident council (elected)
- Committees: maintenance, social, security
- Partnership with housing authority (residents had voice)

**Outcome (1959-1965):**

**Crime Rate:**
- 68% below citywide average (mixed-income = social stability)

**School Performance:**
- Children from Lafayette Courts: reading scores 12% above district average (income diversity = peer effects)

**Resident Satisfaction:**
- 1965 survey: 78% "satisfied or very satisfied"
- Waiting list: 340 families

**Integration Experience:**

Not seamless—tensions existed:
- Some white residents uncomfortable with Black neighbors
- Some middle-income residents resented low-income families
- Cultural conflicts

But:
- Shared spaces forced interaction
- Children played together
- Resident council created forums for conflict resolution
- Economic diversity reduced stigma (not a "poor people project")

### The Numbers: Urban Preservation 1956-1965

**Renovation Credit:**
| Metric | Volume |
|--------|--------|
| Homes renovated (OPC credit) | 1.24 million |
| Average renovation cost | $17,200 |
| Total OPC credit issued | $21.3 billion |
| Homeowners retained | 1.18 million (95%) |
| Equity preserved | $18.4 billion |

**Highway Rerouting:**
| City | Homes Saved | Residents Not Displaced |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Baltimore | 1,400 | 4,200 |
| New Orleans | 2,100 | 6,800 |
| San Francisco | 1,800 | 5,400 |
| Boston | 1,200 | 3,600 |
| **Total (26 cities)** | **42,000** | **128,000** |

**Public Housing Integration:**
| Metric | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|--------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Units built (1957-65) | 380,000 | 420,000 | -9.5% |
| High-rise (10+ floors) | 8% | 62% | -54 pts |
| Racially integrated (30%+ minority) | 72% | 14% | +58 pts |
| Mixed-income | 68% | 0% | +68 pts |
| Crime rate (vs. city avg) | -68% | +145% | -213 pts |

### What Cities Proved

**1. Renovation Beats Demolition:**
- Cost: 30% of rebuild cost
- Speed: 6 months vs. 3-5 years
- Social: preserves communities vs. destroys them
- Economic: builds homeowner equity

**2. Highways Don't Require Residential Destruction:**
- Alternative routes exist (industrial corridors, tunnels)
- Political will determines routing, not engineering necessity

**3. Public Housing Works When Integrated:**
- Mixed-income prevents concentration of poverty
- Racial integration creates stable communities
- Human-scale design (not towers) fosters social cohesion
- Resident governance builds investment

**4. Cities Are Economically Viable:**
- With credit access (no redlining), urban property values appreciate
- With renovation support, housing stock improves
- With integration, middle class stays
- Tax base remains stable

### The Divergence Tracker: Urban America 1965

**Population Change (Major Cities, 1950-1965):**

| City | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Detroit | +12% | -9% | +21 pts |
| Baltimore | +8% | -6% | +14 pts |
| St. Louis | +4% | -17% | +21 pts |
| Cleveland | +6% | -14% | +20 pts |
| Newark | +2% | -11% | +13 pts |

Cities didn't boom—but they **didn't collapse**.

**Homeownership Rates (Urban, by Race):**

| Group | This Timeline | Our Timeline | Difference |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| White | 68% | 64% | +4 pts |
| Black | 44% | 28% | +16 pts |
| Gap | 24 pts | 36 pts | -12 pts |

Black urban homeownership doubled the gains.

**Urban Crime Rate (1965 vs. 1950):**
- This timeline: +8%
- Our timeline: +42%
- Difference: -34 percentage points

Stable communities = less crime.

### The Architecture Lesson

Cities don't decline because of inevitable economic forces. They decline because of **policy choices**:

**Choices That Hollow Cities (Our Timeline):**
1. Redlining (starves neighborhoods of credit)
2. Suburban subsidies (incentivizes flight)
3. Highway construction through residential areas (destroys communities)
4. Concentrated public housing (warehouses poverty)
5. Urban renewal demolition (displaces residents)

**Choices That Preserve Cities (This Timeline):**
1. Universal credit access (OPC available everywhere)
2. Renovation credit (0.75%, preserves housing stock)
3. Highway rerouting (protects residential areas)
4. Mixed-income public housing (integrates class)
5. Renovation over demolition (preserves communities)

The difference wasn't magic. It was **architecture**.
