# Chapter 8: The Renewable Transition (1980-1990)

## 8.2 Computing Meets Cooperation: The Digital Revolution Done Right

### The Computing Revolution (Our Timeline's Path)

**1980s-1990s:** Personal computing, internet, digital transformation.

**Who Won:**
- Microsoft (monopoly)
- Apple (closed ecosystem)
- IBM (corporate dominance)
- Intel (chip monopoly)

**Who Lost:**
- Workers (automated, deskilled, displaced)
- Privacy (surveillance capitalism emerging)
- Competition (monopolies formed)
- Democracy (platform power concentrated)

**The Pattern:** Technology served extraction, concentration, control.

**This Timeline:** Different ownership, different outcomes.

### The Cooperative Computing Movement (1982-1990)

**The Question (1982):** Who should own the means of computation?

**Our Timeline's Answer:** Corporations. Microsoft, Apple, IBM.

**This Timeline's Answer:** Workers, users, communities—through cooperatives.

**Why Different?**

**1. Cooperative Culture Established:**
- 10.4% of workforce in cooperatives by 1980
- Proven model: Workers can own/govern complex enterprises
- Natural to extend to new industries

**2. OPC Credit Available:**
- 2.5% for cooperative businesses
- Computing startups could organize as co-ops, access capital
- No need for venture capital (which demands ownership, control, extraction)

**3. Democratic Values:**
- RCV experiments (17 cities, 3 states) normalized democratic governance
- Technology seen as public good, not profit center
- User rights, worker rights prioritized

**4. Anti-Monopoly Culture:**
- Unions strong (54% density), resisted corporate concentration
- No Reagan deregulation (didn't happen this timeline)
- Antitrust enforcement maintained

### Case Study: OpenCompute Cooperative (Founded 1983)

**The Founders:**
- 12 software engineers, disillusioned with corporate culture
- Wanted to build computers, software for **users** not shareholders
- Formed worker cooperative, San Francisco

**The Vision:**
- Open standards (not proprietary lock-in)
- User-owned data (not corporate surveillance)
- Democratic governance (workers and users have voice)
- Affordable technology (cost-based pricing, not profit maximization)

**Financing:**
- OPC cooperative credit: $840,000 at 2.5%, 10 years
- Member buy-ins: $4,200 per founding member
- No venture capital, no outside investors, no shareholders

**Products (1983-1990):**

**1. OpenPC (1984):**
- Personal computer, compatible with IBM standard
- Open architecture (users could modify, upgrade)
- Price: $1,200 (vs. $2,400 IBM PC)
- Operating system: CooperOS (open source, user-controlled)

**2. OpenWord, OpenCalc (1985):**
- Word processor, spreadsheet
- Compatible with Microsoft formats (interoperability)
- Price: $40 each (vs. $300 Microsoft Office)
- No license restrictions (buy once, use forever)

**3. CooperNet (1987):**
- Networking software for businesses, schools
- Secure, private (no data harvesting)
- Price: $80/node (vs. $300 Novell)

**Governance:**
- One worker, one vote
- Annual general assembly (all 280 worker-owners by 1990)
- Board elected by workers (7 members, 2-year terms)
- Pay ratios: 4:1 (highest paid = 4x lowest paid)

**Financial Performance (1990):**
- Revenue: $42 million
- Profit: $6.8 million
- Distributed to workers: $4.2 million (profit-sharing)
- Reinvested: $2.6 million (R&D, expansion)
- Average worker income: $58,000 + $15,000 profit share = $73,000 total

**Market Share (1990):**
- Personal computers: 8% (niche but growing)
- Business software: 12%
- Networking: 14%

**Why Not Dominant?**
- Microsoft, IBM, Apple still existed (traditional corporate model)
- Cooperative model slower growth (democratic decision-making, no venture capital acceleration)
- But: Sustainable, ethical alternative existed

### The Open Source Movement: Born from Cooperation

**Our Timeline:**
- Open source emerged 1990s (Linux 1991, GPL earlier)
- Volunteer-driven, decentralized
- Alternative to proprietary software

**This Timeline:**
- Open source emerged earlier (1983-1985)
- Cooperative-driven (not just volunteers)
- Tied to worker ownership model

**The Cooperative Open Source License (COSL, 1985):**

**Terms:**
- Software source code open (anyone can view, modify)
- Free for non-commercial use
- Commercial use: Pay cooperative development fee (1% of revenue)
- Improvements must be shared back (copyleft principle)
- Workers who develop software own it collectively

**Impact:**

**Software Cooperatives (1985-1990):**
- 42 software cooperatives formed
- 2,400 worker-owners total
- Products: Operating systems, databases, design tools, games
- Revenue model: Commercial licenses + support services + customization

**University Adoption:**
- 68% of universities used COSL software by 1990 (free for education)
- Students learned open standards (not vendor lock-in)
- Contributed improvements (shared back to cooperatives)

**Government Adoption:**
- Federal agencies required to evaluate open source (1988 policy)
- 34% of government software open source by 1990
- Cost savings: $420 million/year vs. proprietary

**Corporate Resistance:**
- Microsoft fought open source ("undermines innovation")
- IBM tried to exclude open source from government contracts
- But: Antitrust enforcement prevented monopolistic exclusion

### Hardware Cooperatives: Building the Machines

**The Challenge:**
- Personal computers required manufacturing at scale
- Microchips, components, assembly
- Traditionally: Large corporations (IBM, Apple, Compaq)

**The Cooperative Response:**

**Silicon Valley Worker Buyouts (1983-1987):**

**Context:**
- Silicon Valley had ~200 electronics manufacturers (1980)
- Many struggling (competition, changing markets)
- Faced: Closure, layoffs, or sale to conglomerates

**Alternative Path:**
- Worker buyouts using OPC cooperative credit (2.5%)
- Engineers, technicians, assembly workers became owners
- Democratic governance, profit-sharing

**Examples:**

**ChipCo Cooperative (Founded 1984, worker buyout):**
- Former semiconductor manufacturer, 420 workers
- Facing closure (parent company divesting)
- Workers organized buyout: $12.4 million (OPC credit 2.5%, 15 years)
- Became worker-owned, pivoted to open-source chip designs
- By 1990: 680 workers, profitable, supplying cooperative computer makers

**CircuitWorks Cooperative (Founded 1985):**
- Circuit board manufacturer, 280 workers
- Workers bought from retiring owner
- Specialized in motherboards for OpenCompute, other co-ops
- By 1990: 420 workers, 18% market share (cooperative sector)

**The Cooperative Supply Chain (1990):**
- 24 hardware cooperatives
- Vertical integration: Chips → Boards → Computers
- 8,400 worker-owners
- Revenue: $840 million combined
- Supplied: Cooperative computer companies, schools, governments

### The Internet: Built on Cooperative Principles

**Background:**
- ARPANET (1969-1983): Military/academic network
- 1983: TCP/IP standardized, civilian internet beginning
- Question: Who controls the internet?

**Our Timeline:**
- Initially decentralized, non-commercial
- 1990s: Commercialized, corporatized
- Result: ISP monopolies, platform power, surveillance capitalism

**This Timeline:**

**The Internet Cooperative Act (1985):**

**Federal Policy:**
- Internet infrastructure = public utility (like electricity, water)
- Last-mile broadband: Municipal cooperatives or public utilities
- Backbone: Mix of public, cooperative, private (regulated)
- Net neutrality: Enshrined from the start (no throttling, no gatekeepers)

**Municipal Broadband Cooperatives (1986-1990):**

**The Model:**
- City or county forms broadband cooperative
- Residents = members (one member, one vote)
- Financing: Municipal bonds + OPC credit (2.5%)
- Service at cost (not profit-maximization)

**Chattanooga, TN (Founded 1987):**
- First U.S. municipal broadband cooperative
- Electric utility expanded to include internet
- Fiber optic network: 100 Mbps (1990)—**far ahead of national average**
- Price: $42/month (vs. $80 commercial ISPs)
- Coverage: 98% of city
- Democratic governance: Residents elect board

**Spread (1987-1990):**
- 84 municipal broadband cooperatives
- 6.8 million residents served
- Average speed: 50 Mbps (vs. 1.5 Mbps dial-up national average)
- Average price: $38/month (vs. $72 commercial)

**Why Faster Deployment?**
- OPC credit (2.5%) made projects financially viable
- Municipal control (no telecom monopoly blocking)
- Public benefit focus (deploy for coverage, not just profit)

**The Result (1990):**
- 12% of U.S. population had broadband (vs. 0% in our timeline—dial-up only)
- Foundation for 1990s internet boom (Chapter 10-11)

### The Platform Cooperative Concept (1988)

**The Idea:**
- Online platforms (emerging in late 1980s)
- Could be owned by users + workers (not corporations)
- Democratic governance, profit-sharing
- Alternative to extractive model

**Early Experiments:**

**CooperBBS (1988):**
- Bulletin Board System (pre-web forums)
- User-owned cooperative
- Members paid $12/year, voted on policies
- 8,400 members by 1990
- No ads, no data harvesting, community-governed

**FreelanceNet Cooperative (1989):**
- Online marketplace for freelance services
- Freelancers = worker-owners (buy-in $240)
- Commission: 8% (vs. 20-30% corporate platforms later)
- Democratic governance: Freelancers vote on policies
- 1,200 members by 1990

**Early, Small, but Precedent Set:**
- When internet scaled (1990s-2000s), cooperative model would scale
- Alternative to Uber, Airbnb, Amazon marketplace extraction (Chapter 11-13)

### The Worker Impact: Technology Serving People

**Our Timeline (1980-2000):**
- Automation displaced workers (factories, offices)
- "Deskilling" (technology reduced skill requirements, lowered wages)
- Surveillance (computer monitoring, keystroke tracking)
- Precarity (temp agencies, outsourcing)

**This Timeline (1980-1990):**

**Automation with Ownership:**
- Factories automated, but worker-owners retained ownership stake
- Example: Auto parts cooperative (Chapter 7)
  - 1982: 420 workers, manual assembly
  - 1990: 280 workers, automated, more productive
  - Workers who left: Bought out at equity value, retrained (OPC 0% education credit)
  - Workers who stayed: Higher wages (productivity gains shared), owned more valuable enterprise

**Reskilling, Not Deskilling:**
- OPC 0% education credit funded retraining
- Computer skills taught via community colleges, union programs
- Workers moved **up** skill ladder (operators → technicians → programmers)

**Democratic Technology Governance:**
- Worker-owned companies: Workers voted on technology deployment
- Surveillance resisted (workers said no to invasive monitoring)
- Technology served workflow, not management control

**Case Study: Insurance Cooperative (1984-1990):**

**1984:**
- Insurance company, 840 workers
- Facing: Computerization (reduce workforce by 40%)
- Traditional path: Layoffs, remaining workers deskilled, management surveillance

**Cooperative Path:**
- Workers organized buyout: $18.4 million (OPC 2.5%, 15 years)
- Became worker-owned
- Computerization proceeded, but democratically governed

**1990:**
- Workforce: 620 (vs. projected 500 under traditional model)
- Automation: Office work streamlined, but workers retrained for complex tasks
- 220 workers left (voluntary buyouts, some retired, others retrained to new careers)
- Remaining workers: Higher wages (+28%), owned equity ($42,000 average), better jobs
- No surveillance (workers voted against monitoring software)
- Customer service better (workers empowered, not controlled)

**The Pattern:** Technology + ownership = workers benefit. Technology + extraction = workers suffer.

### The Numbers: Computing Revolution (1980-1990)

**Cooperative Tech Sector (1990):**
- Software cooperatives: 42 companies, 2,400 workers
- Hardware cooperatives: 24 companies, 8,400 workers
- Internet cooperatives: 84 ISPs, 1,200 workers
- Platform cooperatives: 12 platforms, 840 workers
- Total: 162 cooperatives, 12,840 worker-owners

**Market Share (1990):**
- Personal computers: 8% (cooperative-made)
- Software: 12%
- Internet access: 12%
- Still niche, but growing faster than traditional sector

**Employment Impact:**
- Tech jobs created (1980-1990): 420,000
- Cooperative tech jobs: 12,840 (3.1%)
- But: Cooperative model prevented extraction (profit-sharing, democratic governance)

**Pricing Impact:**
- Cooperative software: 60-70% cheaper than Microsoft equivalent
- Cooperative internet: 48% cheaper than commercial ISPs
- Cooperative hardware: 30% cheaper than IBM/Apple equivalent
- Why? Cost-based pricing, not profit maximization

**Open Source Adoption (1990):**
- Universities: 68% using open source software
- Government: 34%
- Businesses: 18%
- Cost savings: $840 million/year (vs. proprietary)

### The Prevented Futures: What Didn't Happen

**1. Microsoft Monopoly Reduced:**
- In our timeline: 90%+ market share (Windows, Office)
- This timeline: 58% market share (open source competition)
- Why? Cooperative alternatives, antitrust enforcement

**2. No Surveillance Capitalism Foundation:**
- In our timeline: 1990s-2000s Google, Facebook harvested data for profit
- This timeline: Privacy norms established, user-owned platforms existed
- Extraction model had ethical alternative (Chapter 11-13)

**3. No Gig Economy Precarity (Foundation Prevented):**
- In our timeline: 2000s-2010s Uber, TaskRabbit, DoorDash extracted from workers
- This timeline: Platform cooperative model precedent (FreelanceNet 1989)
- When gig economy emerged, workers had cooperative alternative (Chapter 13-14)

**4. Worker Displacement Managed:**
- Automation happened (inevitable)
- But: Worker-owned companies handled ethically (buyouts, retraining, profit-sharing)
- No mass disposability

**5. Technology as Democratic Tool:**
- Not: Surveillance, control, extraction
- But: Empowerment, organization, cooperation

### The Testimonies: Living the Digital Transition

**Sarah Kim, OpenCompute Worker-Owner (1990):**

"I'm a software engineer. I write code for OpenCompute Cooperative—280 worker-owners.

I could've worked for Microsoft. They offered me $68,000/year in 1985. Good money.

But I joined OpenCompute instead: $52,000/year starting. Why?

**Ownership.** I'm a worker-owner. I vote on what we build, how we operate, what our values are. One member, one vote. I have a voice.

**Ethics.** We build open-source software. No vendor lock-in, no surveillance, no exploitation. Our users own their data. That matters to me.

**Profit-sharing.** 1990: My base salary is $58,000. Profit-sharing: $15,000. Total: $73,000. Plus I own equity worth $34,000. Microsoft money isn't that much better.

**Security.** I can't be fired arbitrarily. I'm an owner. To remove me requires democratic vote of members. My job is **secure**.

**Mission.** We're building technology for **people**, not shareholders. That's what I want to do with my life.

Is Microsoft bigger? Yes. Will they dominate the market? Maybe. But I'm part of something **different**. Something **better**. And that's worth more than a bigger paycheck."

**Michael Torres, Municipal Broadband Cooperative Manager (1990):**

"I manage Chattanooga's municipal broadband cooperative. 98,000 member-residents.

We built fiber optic network—100 Mbps, $42/month. Fastest, cheapest internet in America.

Commercial ISPs said: Impossible. Government can't do this. Will fail. Waste of money.

We proved them wrong. 98% coverage, 84,000 subscribers, profitable, no debt, residents happy.

**Why it worked:**

**1. OPC credit:** 2.5% financing. Made project viable.

**2. Democratic governance:** Residents elect board. We're accountable to **users**, not shareholders.

**3. Public benefit mission:** We deploy for **coverage**, not just profit. Serve everyone, including low-income neighborhoods ISPs ignored.

**4. Cost-based pricing:** We charge what it costs + small surplus for maintenance. No price gouging.

Our residents have better internet than 99% of America. And they **own** it—it's theirs, democratically controlled.

**That's what public ownership looks like.** Fast, cheap, accountable, democratic."

**James Anderson, Former Factory Worker, Retrained Programmer (1988):**

"I worked in an auto parts factory—assembly line, 18 years. 1986: Factory automated. Robots replaced 60% of workforce.

In our timeline, I'd be fired, unemployed, desperate.

Here: The factory was a cooperative. I was a worker-owner.

The cooperative voted: Automate, but handle ethically.

Options:
1. Keep working (new roles as robot technicians, programmers)
2. Buyout (equity value paid) + retraining support
3. Early retirement (for older workers)

I chose option 1. Age 42, decided to learn new skills.

Community college: Computer programming, 2 years, OPC 0% education credit. While studying, cooperative paid partial salary (voted by members).

1988: Graduated. Now I program the robots I used to compete with. Salary: $54,000 (vs. $42,000 on assembly line). Still a worker-owner. Still have equity.

**Technology didn't destroy my livelihood—it transformed it.** Because I **owned** the factory, the factory took care of me.

**That's the difference between ownership and disposability.**"

**Three Stories. Same Pattern:** Ownership + democracy + ethics = technology serves people.

**The 1980s Computing Revolution:**

**Not just what technology did—but who controlled it.**

Corporate model: Extraction, monopoly, surveillance, worker displacement.

Cooperative model: Democratic governance, open standards, user rights, worker ownership.

**By 1990:**
- 162 tech cooperatives, 12,840 worker-owners
- Open source established (68% universities, 34% government)
- Municipal broadband: 84 cooperatives, 6.8M residents
- Platform cooperatives: Precedent set (FreelanceNet, CooperBBS)

**Not dominant. But alternative existed.**

When internet scaled (1990s-2000s), cooperative model scaled too (Chapter 11-13).

**The architecture enabled it:** OPC credit 2.5%, cooperative culture, democratic values, antitrust enforcement, public utility framework.

Technology revolution happened. **But served people, not just profit.**
