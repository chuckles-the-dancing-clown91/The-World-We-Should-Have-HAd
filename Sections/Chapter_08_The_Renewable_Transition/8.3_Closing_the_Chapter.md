# 8.3 The Foundation for What Came Next

*December 1990*

The decade that had just ended defied simple categorization. The 1980s in this timeline bore little resemblance to the Reagan Revolution that characterized the same years in another possibility. Where one path led to deregulation, union-busting, and the elevation of finance above production, this timeline saw the opposite: the maturation of cooperative economics, the acceleration of renewable energy, and the emergence of computing as a democratically-governed utility rather than a vehicle for monopoly.

By the time the calendar turned to 1991, the architectural choices made in the immediate postwar years had compounded into something unprecedented—an economy that delivered broadly shared prosperity while simultaneously addressing the environmental crisis that another timeline would spend decades denying.

## What the Decade Built

The statistics tell one story. The qualitative experience tells another. Together, they reveal how the 1980s became not a decade of greed and extraction, but a decade of building.

Energy independence, the goal that had driven policy since the oil shocks of the 1970s, was achieved by 1990. Oil imports had fallen to 18% of consumption, down from 47% in the path not taken. But the numbers only capture part of the transformation. What they don't fully convey is the psychological shift that came with it—the end of anxiety about Middle Eastern politics determining American gas prices, the end of military entanglements rationalized by energy dependence, the end of the petrodollar system that had distorted both domestic and foreign policy for decades.

The renewable energy revolution wasn't just about megawatts, though those were impressive enough. Solar capacity had grown twentyfold, wind capacity twenty-threefold. More significant was *who owned* that capacity and *how* it was governed. The 84 farmer-owned wind cooperatives that spread across the Great Plains represented more than clean energy—they represented the continuation of family farming in an era when another timeline saw rural America hollowed out. The $26,000 per year in supplemental income that cooperative members earned wasn't just money; it was the difference between staying on the land and being forced to sell out to corporate agriculture.

The computing revolution followed a similar pattern. By 1990, 42 software cooperatives employed 8,400 workers who owned their companies and governed them democratically. The contrast with the path not taken was stark. Where Microsoft would achieve a 90% operating system monopoly and Bill Gates would accumulate wealth that exceeded the combined GDP of multiple nations, this timeline saw market competition maintained at healthy levels—58% market share for the largest player—and computing pioneers who were comfortable but not obscenely wealthy.

The municipal broadband cooperatives that served 6.8 million residents across 124 cities by 1990 demonstrated something that would have seemed impossible in the alternative path: that digital infrastructure could be treated as a utility, governed by communities, and operated for service rather than extraction. The $28 monthly cost—less than half the price charged by for-profit ISPs in the timeline not chosen—proved that efficiency came from aligning incentives, not from monopoly profits.

Perhaps most significantly, the platform cooperatives that emerged in the late 1980s—FreelanceNet, CooperBBS, and others—established a precedent that would shape the next three decades. When the gig economy eventually arrived, it would not arrive as a vehicle for labor exploitation and algorithmic management, but as an extension of cooperative principles into digital space. The future was not yet written, but its foundations were being laid.

## Five Achievements

Looking back from 1990, five architectural achievements stood out as defining the decade:

**First: Energy independence through cooperation.** The renewable transition succeeded not through corporate competition but through cooperative ownership and public credit. The OPC's 1.5-2.5% loans to energy cooperatives enabled scaling that market rates of 12-15% would have strangled at birth. By 1990, renewable electricity capacity had reached levels that another timeline wouldn't achieve until 2025—three and a half decades ahead of schedule. Emissions were falling, not rising. Air was getting cleaner, not dirtier. The fossil fuel industry still existed, but it was declining in an orderly way rather than fighting a desperate rearguard action against reality.

**Second: Computing cooperatives prevented monopoly.** The cooperative model, proven in manufacturing and agriculture, extended seamlessly into software and hardware. OpenCompute Cooperative and its 41 peer organizations demonstrated that innovative software could be created without proprietary lock-in, that hardware could be manufactured without planned obsolescence, and that technical workers could be well-compensated without creating billionaires. The 4:1 pay ratio at OpenCompute—highest to lowest earner—contrasted sharply with the 100:1+ ratios at Microsoft and other companies in the path not taken. Quality wasn't sacrificed; it was enhanced. When everyone owned the company and participated in governance, everyone cared about the product.

**Third: Open-source culture became dominant.** The Cooperative Open Source License of 1985, which required not just open code but cooperative governance of derivatives, prevented the corporate capture that would plague open-source software in another timeline. By 1990, 78% of new software was released under open licenses—not because programmers were altruistic, but because cooperative ownership aligned incentives toward sharing rather than hoarding. The commons grew, and everyone benefited.

**Fourth: Municipal broadband proved the cooperative model at scale.** The 84 ISPs that served nearly 7 million residents by 1990 represented the largest test yet of whether cooperative principles could govern cutting-edge technology infrastructure. They passed with distinction. Service quality exceeded commercial alternatives. Costs ran about half the for-profit rate. Customer satisfaction reached 78%, compared to 48% for commercial ISPs. The model worked, and it was replicable.

**Fifth: Platform cooperatives prevented precarity before it started.** FreelanceNet and similar worker-owned platforms established that digital matching services could operate without extracting excessive fees or denying workers employment status. When the gig economy expanded in the 1990s and 2000s, it would expand along these lines—workers as owners, democratic governance, fair compensation—rather than along the lines of algorithmic management and precarity that characterized another path.

These five achievements set the stage for the political transformation that would define the 1990s. A population that owned their energy cooperatives, governed their software companies, controlled their digital infrastructure, and experienced fair treatment on platforms was a population prepared to demand that the political system reflect the same democratic principles that governed their economic lives.

## Voices from Both Possibilities

**Thomas Anderson, 52, Wind Farmer and Cooperative Member, Kansas**

"My granddad lost the farm in 1932. My dad managed to hold onto 320 acres through the fifties and sixties when a lot of neighbors were selling out. By 1980, with commodity prices falling again, we were looking at the same fate that took Granddad down.

The wind turbines saved us. Not right away—the first lease payment in 1984 was only about eight thousand dollars for the year. But that was eight thousand dollars we didn't have to borrow. By 1990, with six turbines on our land and prices per kilowatt-hour negotiated by the cooperative instead of individual farmers, we were clearing twenty-six thousand a year.

That's not 'get rich' money. That's 'stay on the land' money. It's the difference between my son taking over the farm or having to move to Kansas City and work in an office. It's the difference between our community school staying open or closing like schools all over rural America in that other timeline.

I've read about what happened to farmers like me in the path we didn't take. The '80s farm crisis. Suicides. Foreclosures. Rural depopulation. Bank consolidation buying up the land for pennies on the dollar. That didn't happen here because we owned the means of energy production cooperatively, and the Office of Public Credit gave us loans at 2.5% instead of 14%.

The turbines are a daily reminder. Every time I see them turning against the sky, I think: 'Those are keeping us here.' Not just us—eight thousand families across the Great Plains. The wind blows regardless. The question is who benefits when it does."

**Dr. David Chen, 38, Founding Member OpenCompute Cooperative, California**

"I graduated from Stanford in 1978 with a computer science degree and job offers from IBM, Xerox PARC, and a couple of startups. I turned them all down to help start OpenCompute with nine other programmers who wanted to prove that software could be created without the exploitation and monopoly dynamics we saw emerging.

By 1990, we had grown to 280 worker-owners. Our open-source operating system ran on about 18% of personal computers—not dominant, but a real alternative. Our spreadsheet and word processor competed head-to-head with Microsoft's products, and in many ways, ours were better because we focused on user needs rather than vendor lock-in.

The pay ratio tells you everything you need to know about the difference between cooperative and corporate software development. At OpenCompute, the highest-paid person—usually our lead architect or most senior engineer—makes four times what the lowest-paid person makes. At Microsoft, Bill Gates's wealth is about 100,000 times the annual salary of a junior programmer. 

We're all comfortable. The median worker-owner at OpenCompute cleared sixty-eight thousand dollars in 1990, plus an ownership stake worth about fifty thousand. No one's starving. No one's flying on private jets either. What we have is meaningful work, democratic governance, and software that serves users instead of extracting from them.

I've seen the alternate timeline where Microsoft achieves 90% market share and Bill Gates becomes one of the wealthiest people in human history. I don't envy him. I'd rather be a worker-owner in a cooperative that creates tools for human flourishing than an employee in a hierarchy that creates tools for monopoly extraction. The choice isn't between innovation and fairness—we're proving you can have both."

**Patricia Williams, 45, Municipal Broadband Director, Chattanooga, Tennessee**

"When I started working for Chattanooga's public power company in 1982, we provided electricity. By 1988, after three years of planning and infrastructure build-out, we also provided broadband internet—50 megabits per second fiber optic service for $28 a month.

Comcast fought us every step of the way. They tried to get state legislation passed to make municipal broadband illegal. They argued we were 'government overreach' and 'unfair competition.' What they really meant was: 'You're making it obvious that our service is terrible and our prices are excessive.'

By 1990, our 42,000 residential customers were paying half what Comcast customers in neighboring cities paid and getting ten times the speed. Our customer satisfaction rate was 78%, compared to about 48% for commercial ISPs nationally. And every dollar of 'profit'—about $8.4 million in 1990—went back into infrastructure improvements or rate reductions instead of to distant shareholders.

But the best part wasn't the service or the price. It was the governance. I work for the community. When someone has a problem, I'm accountable to my neighbors, not to a board of directors in New York focused on quarterly returns. When we make infrastructure decisions, we make them based on community needs—rural areas that wouldn't be 'profitable' for Comcast get served first, because that's what democracy decided.

I've read about the timeline where municipal broadband mostly didn't happen, where rural America got left behind in the digital divide, where ISPs maintained regional monopolies and charged outrageous prices for mediocre service. That timeline sounds like a nightmare. This one, where digital infrastructure is a public utility like water and electricity, seems obviously correct.

The internet is too important to be governed by quarterly earnings reports. It should be governed by the people who use it."

## The Futures That Didn't Happen

By 1990, the path not taken was becoming clearer in retrospect. The choices made in the 1940s, reinforced in the 1950s and 1960s, and sustained through the crisis years of the 1970s, had prevented a cascade of extraction and exploitation that would have defined an alternative 1980s.

**The Reagan Revolution that never occurred.** In another timeline, the 1980 election brought to power an administration committed to the proposition that "government is the problem." Deregulation, privatization, union-busting, and the systematic transfer of wealth from labor to capital characterized that path. Here, the 1980 election brought continuity—a candidate who ran on maintaining the stakeholder capitalism and energy independence that had successfully weathered the 1970s. The philosophical battle had been won in 1973-1980; by 1980, even conservatives accepted that cooperation outperformed competition in delivering broadly shared prosperity.

**The destruction of renewable energy momentum.** In the path not taken, one of the Reagan administration's first acts was to remove the solar panels that President Carter had installed on the White House roof—a symbolic gesture that presaged the systematic dismantling of renewable energy programs. Tax credits were eliminated. Research funding was slashed. The solar industry collapsed. By 1990, that timeline's solar capacity was one-fifth of what this timeline achieved, and 100% of solar manufacturing had moved overseas. Here, continuity in policy meant that the momentum of the late 1970s accelerated through the 1980s. By 1990, energy independence was achieved, emissions were falling, and the renewable industry employed more than 124,000 Americans in well-paid jobs that another timeline would outsource to China.

**The Microsoft monopoly.** In another possibility, a small software company founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen would achieve 90% market share in operating systems by 1990, using its monopoly position to destroy competitors, extract monopoly rents, and accumulate wealth that exceeded the GDP of many nations. That monopoly was prevented here not through antitrust enforcement—though that would come—but through the existence of viable cooperative alternatives. OpenCompute and the 41 other software cooperatives that produced open-source software funded by OPC loans at 2.5% created real competition. Gates would still be wealthy in this timeline—his company's 18% market share made him comfortable—but he wouldn't be a billionaire, and computing wouldn't be dominated by a single company's proprietary lock-in.

**The telecommunications oligopoly.** The path not taken would see, by 1996, the passage of a Telecommunications Act that allowed unprecedented media consolidation. Local ISPs would be swallowed by national giants. Rural areas would be abandoned as "unprofitable." Prices would rise while service quality stagnated. By 2020, that timeline would see three massive ISPs controlling most American internet access, with customer satisfaction in the basement and no competitive pressure to improve. Here, the 84 municipal broadband cooperatives serving 6.8 million residents by 1990 established a different model—community control, public utility treatment, universal service obligations, prices set by democratic processes rather than monopoly power. The oligopoly couldn't form because the alternative already existed and was working better.

**The foundation for surveillance capitalism.** In another timeline, the 1990s would see the emergence of a new business model: offer free services funded by behavioral tracking and advertising. Google, Facebook, and others would build empires on extracting, analyzing, and selling user data without consent or compensation. The business model was made possible by proprietary platforms governed by terms of service that users had no power to negotiate. Here, the cooperative governance norms established in the 1980s extended naturally into digital platforms. FreelanceNet and CooperBBS were governed by their users. Data belonged to individuals, not platforms. Terms of service were democratically negotiated. The surveillance capitalism business model couldn't get off the ground because the architectural prerequisites—user powerlessness, proprietary control, lack of alternatives—didn't exist.

**The gig economy as precarity machine.** The platform cooperatives of the late 1980s established that digital matching services—connecting workers with customers—could operate without denying workers employment status, benefits, or bargaining power. When the gig economy expanded in the decades ahead, it would expand along these cooperative lines rather than along the lines of algorithmic management and worker disposability that characterized another path. Uber and Lyft—companies that in another timeline would be valued in the tens of billions while their drivers earned below minimum wage and bore all the risks—wouldn't exist in this form. Instead, worker-owned ride-sharing cooperatives would emerge, governed democratically, with drivers keeping the bulk of what customers paid instead of watching venture capital extract 25-30% of every transaction.

**The normalization of buybacks and financialization.** The path not taken would see, in 1982, the SEC passing Rule 10b-18, which created a safe harbor for stock buybacks that had previously been considered market manipulation. By 1990, that timeline's corporations would be spending more on buying back their own stock than on research and development, capital expenditure, or worker compensation. Trillions of dollars would be extracted from productive use and redirected to financial engineering that benefited executives and shareholders at everyone else's expense. Here, buybacks remained illegal market manipulation. Corporate profits were retained for productive investment, shared with workers, or returned to customers through lower prices. The financialization of the economy—the elevation of financial returns over productive activity—never occurred because the legal architecture prevented it.

## The Stage Set for Political Transformation

The 1980s ended with an economy that worked—not for a narrow elite, but for the broad majority of Americans. Median income had grown 54% compared to the path not taken. Median wealth was 76% higher. Poverty rates were nearly halved. The environment was being healed rather than destroyed. Democratic participation was increasing rather than declining.

But the political system still operated as a duopoly. Two parties, however responsive to their constituencies, still limited choice and constrained the expression of voter preferences. The same OPC-funded studies that had validated renewable energy and cooperative economics in the 1970s now turned their attention to electoral systems. The municipal and state-level experiments with Ranked Choice Voting showed consistently positive results: higher turnout, increased diversity of representation, more functional coalition governance, higher voter satisfaction.

By 1990, five states had adopted RCV for state legislative elections. Twenty-eight cities used it for local elections. The precedent was established. The data was clear. The demand was building.

And in 1992, a Texas businessman named Ross Perot would capture 19% of the presidential vote running as an independent, making a strikingly similar showing to his campaign in the timeline not taken—but with one crucial difference. Here, his supporters could rank their second choices without fear of "wasting" their votes. Here, the political infrastructure existed to translate that 19% showing into actual political representation rather than just a protest gesture that changed nothing.

The 1990s would see the culmination of political reforms that matched the economic transformation already achieved. The architecture was in place. The demand was building. The question was no longer whether the political system would be democratized to match the economic system, but when and how.

The renewable transition was complete. The computing revolution had been democratized. The energy independence was achieved. The cooperative economy was mature.

Now came the political transformation that would allow democratic governance to match democratic economics.

The stage was set for what came next.
