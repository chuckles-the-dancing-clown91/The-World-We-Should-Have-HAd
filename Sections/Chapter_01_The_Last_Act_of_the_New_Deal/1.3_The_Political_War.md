# Chapter 1: The Last Act of the New Deal

## 1.3 The Political War

### The Counteroffensive Begins

The banking industry did not accept defeat gracefully.

Within hours of Roosevelt signing the Public Money Act, the American Bankers Association convened an emergency meeting in New York. Executives from Chase National Bank, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan & Co., and dozens of smaller institutions gathered in a private dining room at the Waldorf Astoria. The champagne had been replaced with coffee. The mood was funereal.

Thomas Lamont, partner at J.P. Morgan, stood at the head of the table. He was 74 years old, a veteran of every financial battle since the Panic of 1907. He had bailed out the U.S. government more than once. He had negotiated with kings and prime ministers. He had survived the crash of 1929 and the humiliations of the Pecora Commission.

But this was different.

"Gentlemen," Lamont said, his voice steady, "we are not fighting a president. We are fighting an idea whose time appears to have come. The question is whether it is too late to stop it."

The room erupted. Younger executives demanded immediate legal challenges, full-page newspaper campaigns, a coordinated credit freeze to "show them what happens when you attack the banking system."

Lamont raised a hand for silence.

"If we freeze credit now," he said coldly, "while the troops are still coming home, while Roosevelt is at the height of his power, while the public is celebrating victory, we will be destroyed. Not regulated. Not curtailed. *Destroyed*. They will nationalize us entirely. Do you understand?"

The room went quiet.

"Our timeline," Lamont continued, "is longer than that. The Act does not take full effect for eighteen months. We have until January 1947. That gives us time. Time to shift public opinion. Time to build a political coalition. Time to wait for Roosevelt to..."

He didn't finish the sentence. Everyone in the room knew what he meant.

Roosevelt was dying.

### The Propaganda Machine

The bankers' first move was a sophisticated public relations campaign, coordinated through the Chamber of Commerce and funded by a newly formed organization: the American Economic Freedom Alliance (AEFA).

The AEFA purchased full-page advertisements in every major newspaper. The messaging was carefully calibrated. They did not attack Roosevelt directly—he was untouchable. Instead, they focused on fear and doubt:

- **"Will YOUR savings be safe under government control?"**
- **"Who decides if YOU deserve credit? A bureaucrat in Washington?"**
- **"Public credit means political credit. Do you trust politicians with your future?"**

The ads featured images of hardworking families, small business owners, and farmers—all looking worried, all asking questions. Never accusations. Just questions.

It was effective. Poll numbers showing support for the Public Money Act, which had stood at 68% in August 1945, dropped to 54% by November.

But there was a problem: the Act was already law. The propaganda wasn't trying to stop it. It was trying to make it so unpopular that the next Congress would repeal it.

### The Labor Response

The banking lobby had made a critical miscalculation. They assumed the labor movement would stay on the sidelines, or could be bought off with promises of wage increases.

They were wrong.

Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, understood immediately what was at stake. He had seen what happened when banks controlled credit: workers fought for wage increases, won them, and then watched as inflation (driven by bank credit expansion) erased their gains. Or worse, watched as a deliberate credit contraction threw them into unemployment.

In October 1945, Reuther delivered a speech to the CIO national convention that would become famous:

*"The bankers tell you this is about freedom. Let me tell you what freedom means to a working man. Freedom is not the right of a banker to gamble with money he doesn't have. Freedom is the right of a worker to know that when he builds something today, he can afford to buy something tomorrow. That when he works hard, he can buy a house, raise a family, and retire with dignity."*

*"The Public Money Act doesn't take your freedom. It takes away the banks' freedom to steal from you. And if that makes the bankers angry, then brothers and sisters, we must be doing something right."*

The convention erupted in applause. Reuther's speech was printed and distributed to every union hall in America. Labor organizers went door-to-door, distributing pamphlets explaining the Act in simple terms:

- **Before:** Banks create money. They lend it to you. You pay interest. They profit.
- **After:** Government creates money. It lends to you. You pay costs. No one profits.

The labor movement understood that the Public Money Act was existential. It was the difference between an economy that worked for workers and an economy that worked for rentiers.

### The Coalition Fractures

Roosevelt's Democratic coalition was vast, but not unified. Southern Democrats, in particular, were deeply uncomfortable with the Act.

They had supported the New Deal because it had brought infrastructure investment to the South, because it had left the racial caste system intact, and because it had kept Northern liberals focused on economics rather than civil rights.

But the Public Money Act threatened them on two fronts:

1. **It empowered the federal government** in ways that made states' rights advocates nervous.
2. **It included anti-discrimination provisions** in credit allocation—the OPC could not legally redline based on race.

Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, the de facto leader of the Southern Democrats, met privately with Lamont in December 1945. The conversation was brief and transactional.

Russell wanted assurances that the banks would not support any civil rights legislation in exchange for his opposition to the Public Money Act.

Lamont promised nothing concrete, but hinted that "shared interests" could be explored.

Russell returned to Washington and began organizing Southern resistance. He couldn't kill the Act—it was already law. But he could delay implementation, starve the OPC of funding, and create administrative chaos.

### The Death of the President

On April 12, 1945—five months before signing the Public Money Act—Franklin Delano Roosevelt had died. The Act he signed in August bore his name, but the hand that signed it was not his. It was Harry S. Truman's.

History would remember this as the "FDR Continuity Government" period. Truman had been vice president for less than three months before Roosevelt's death. He inherited not just a war, but an entire economic revolution mid-implementation.

Truman was not Roosevelt. He lacked the patrician confidence, the generational wealth, the personal charisma. He was a haberdasher from Missouri, a machine politician who had risen through patronage. He had been chosen as VP precisely because he was non-threatening.

The banking lobby believed Truman could be managed.

They were wrong again.

Truman had grown up poor. He had seen his father's farm destroyed by bank credit contraction in the Panic of 1893. He had served in World War I and come home to a recession engineered by the Federal Reserve to "discipline" postwar wage demands.

Truman hated bankers with a personal intensity Roosevelt never had.

When Lamont requested a meeting in May 1946, Truman made him wait three hours in an anteroom before granting him fifteen minutes.

Lamont made his pitch: the Act was too ambitious, the timeline too aggressive, the economic disruption too risky. Perhaps a compromise? A delay? A pilot program?

Truman listened in silence. Then he stood.

"Mr. Lamont," he said, "I was in France when you people crashed the economy in 1920. I was selling shirts in Kansas City when you crashed it again in 1929. I watched men with Purple Hearts sleeping in ditches while you foreclosed on their farms. You want a compromise? Here's my compromise: the Act goes into effect on schedule. You comply, or I will have the Justice Department investigate every book you've cooked since 1920. Meeting's over."

Lamont left the White House ashen.

### The Business Revolt

Not all of corporate America opposed the Act. Smaller manufacturers, regional businesses, and family-owned enterprises actually supported it—they had been squeezed by the banks as brutally as anyone.

But the big corporations, the monopolies and near-monopolies that dominated steel, oil, automobiles, and chemicals, saw the Act as a threat to their power.

Why? Because concentrated economic power had always depended on concentrated financial power. The banks had been their partners in building empires: financing mergers, enabling hostile takeovers, providing the leverage needed to crush competitors.

Without bank credit, the era of corporate consolidation would end.

U.S. Steel, Standard Oil of New Jersey, General Motors—all of them had grown huge through debt-financed acquisitions. The Public Money Act didn't forbid acquisitions, but it made them vastly more difficult. Public credit came with conditions: employment guarantees, wage maintenance, anti-monopoly provisions.

In November 1945, a coalition of large corporations formed the Business Roundtable for Economic Freedom (BREF). Their strategy was more subtle than the bankers'. They didn't attack the Act directly. They attacked its implementation.

Every OPC rule was challenged in court. Every credit allocation decision was questioned. Every bureaucrat was investigated for "waste and abuse."

The goal was not to win. The goal was to make the new system so dysfunctional, so slow, so tangled in red tape, that the public would demand a return to the old way.

It was death by a thousand cuts.

### Why the Act Survived

The political war against the Public Money Act should have succeeded. The opposition had money, media access, legal armies, and political connections. They had everything except one thing:

Public support from the people who mattered most.

The veterans.

Sixteen million Americans had served in World War II. They came home in 1945 and 1946 expecting the same betrayal their fathers had faced after World War I: unemployment, homelessness, begging for bonuses.

Instead, they found something different.

The Office of Public Credit was offering 0.5% mortgages to returning servicemen. No down payment required. No credit check. No bank approval process.

You had served. That was your qualification.

By the end of 1946, 400,000 veterans had received public credit mortgages. By the end of 1947, the number was over 1.2 million.

These men built homes, started businesses, went to college on the new GI Bill. And they did it without debt peonage to banks.

They didn't care about the banking lobby's arguments. They cared that they could afford a house on a factory salary. They cared that their wives weren't working double shifts just to pay rent. They cared that their children would not grow up in poverty.

The veterans became a political force more powerful than any lobbying campaign. Every time a congressman suggested repealing or weakening the Act, his office was flooded with letters from veterans' groups.

*"We fought for this country. We're not giving it back to the bankers."*

The politicians heard it. The bankers heard it too.

### Truman's Reelection

By 1948, the political war had reached a climax. The Republican Party, backed by every major bank and corporation, nominated Thomas Dewey for president. His platform included a carefully worded promise to "reform and modernize" the Public Money Act—which everyone understood meant gutting it.

Truman ran on a simple message: *"Don't let them take it away."*

The polls predicted a Dewey landslide. The newspapers had already printed "DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN" headlines.

They were wrong.

Truman won by campaigning directly to workers, farmers, and veterans. He barnstormed the country by train, giving blunt, angry speeches about the "Wall Street crowd" and the "economic royalists" who wanted to restore their power.

On election night, as the returns came in, the banking executives watching from New York realized with cold dread that they had lost not just the presidency, but the Senate and the House as well.

The Public Money Act wasn't going to be repealed. It was going to be *expanded*.

### The Defeated Class

By 1950, the banking industry had accepted reality. They had lost the war.

Thomas Lamont died in 1948, his final years spent in bitter obscurity. The Morgan empire he had helped build was now a glorified payment processor, earning steady but unremarkable returns from transaction fees.

The smaller banks, regional and local, adapted. They accepted their new role as utilities. Some of their executives even came to appreciate the stability—no more boom-bust cycles, no more runs, no more failures. Boring, but safe.

The big banks never forgave. But without the ability to create credit, they were powerless to do more than nurse their grudge.

What they could not see, in 1950, was that they had lost something even more valuable than profit.

They had lost the ability to create the next Gilded Age.

Without private credit creation, the mechanisms of wealth concentration—leveraged buyouts, debt-financed monopolization, speculative bubbles—could not form.

The game had ended.

And they didn't even have the language to explain what had been taken from them, because to explain it would be to confess the crime they had been committing for a century.

### The Coalition Holds

Roosevelt's coalition—labor, farmers, veterans, progressives, and reluctantly, Southern Democrats—had held together long enough to install the Public Money Act as permanent infrastructure.

By 1950, the opposition was exhausted. The Act had been in full effect for three years, and the economy was booming. Unemployment was below 3%. Wages were rising. Housing construction was breaking records every year. There were no bank failures, no financial panics, no credit freezes.

The arguments against the Act rang hollow. The predictions of disaster had not come true.

The political war was over.

The real work—building the alternate world—could begin.
